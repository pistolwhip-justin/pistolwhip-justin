I'm challenging to launch 12 startups in 12 months(Recently launched: [https://5k-dollar-club.com/](https://5k-dollar-club.com/)).

I've researched the amazing indie hackers / entrepreneurs and summarized what they've done.

I would like to introduce the great developer "Steven Cravotta"! He is amazing!

Steven Cravotta, a man who built his first mobile app at the age of 16 and currently earns $40k per month from an app called "Puff Count".

He is not a developer, but has built many successful products while outsourcing development and design.

Let's focus on him!

### 👨‍💻Developing an app at the age of 16 with no knowledge of programming or design

His business building journey began at the age of 16.

He built a mobile app called [Wordle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordle/id1095569891) at the age of 16.

However, he had no knowledge of app development and built a team to develop it based on his own ideas.

The mobile app he built at age 16 did not get much traffic for a long time.

However, five years later, it suddenly came into viral.

A browser-based game with the exact same name, Wordle, became a worldwide hit.

It is quite famous and many of you may know it.

It is a puzzle-solving game in which the player must guess a specific English word within six times.

However, this game was a browser-based game and there was no mobile application.

But users did not know that. Many users looked for this game "Wordle" in mobile apps and found and downloaded Steven's app, which was completely unrelated to the game.

His app had only been downloaded about 1 or 2 times a day until then. After the viral his app started to be downloaded about 40k, 50k times a day.

In one week, the number of downloads exceeded 200,000.

The viral traffic brought him an unexpected windfall.

However, he originally had no intention of monetizing the app, so he decided to donate all the profits to an organization.

And he eventually sold this app Wordle, although I don't know the final deal.

### 🚭️Puff Count development

Now, this all sounds like a one-hit wonder who just happened to get lucky, but that is not the case.

In the five years before he experienced such viral success, he launched a service and grew it well.

That is [Puff Count](https://puffcount.com/).

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*MK2szPv-LBnGDRgVYge6qg.jpeg)

As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, he is earning as much as $40k/month from Puff Count.

Wordle's success alone makes him look like a lucky one-hit wonder, but Puff Count is also profitable, and his business acumen must be acknowledged.

Let's take a closer look at Puff Count.

He launched Puff Count while he was still in college.

Puff Count is an app that helps people quit smoking vape.

Vape sounds healthier than regular cigarettes, but they are considered a problem, especially in Europe and the United States.

Because they are flavored, easy to smoke, and affordable, they are popular mainly among young people, and have become quite a social problem as a product that can rather take young people into cigarette addiction.

The government has been promoting vaping as an alternative product to reduce the effects of smoking, but this has conversely lowered the hurdle for younger people to pick up cigarettes.

Puff Count helps people quit using vape.

It focuses on vape from habit apps, which is a famous theme in mobile apps.

He says it's a good idea to focus the app on a niche genre within a famous theme.

### 🎯Ideas become products through daily awareness and thorough research.

Now, first of all, an idea is needed to create a product.

Let's take a look at how he came up with the idea for Puff Count!

First of all, he always takes note of problems he experiences in his daily life.

By creating an app that solves his own problems, he can gain at least one user: himself.

So which of the inspirations he gets from his daily life will be actually products?

Is there actually a demand for the ideas he comes up with?

Is there room for them?

He will thoroughly investigate the following.

- First, he looks to see if there are competing apps with similar themes.
- Then, he checks Google Trends to see if there is demand for the idea.
- Then he also checks if the theme is trending on Tiktok.

In the case of vape, there were already competing apps, but they are in a niche field and do not seem to be very strong.

Google Trends showed that search demand was growing.

Then he looked at Tiktok and found a video about vape that was getting a lot of viral.

He was convinced that this was a good idea! He decided to build an app to help people quit smoking vape.

While competitive research and Google Trends were somewhat familiar, checking Tiktok was a new idea for me.

Marketing with short videos is quite effective to cut into the existing market.

The viral on Tiktok means there is a significant opportunity there.

If you fight with SEO and advertising, it is very difficult to cut through the existing large companies, but with Tiktok, it is possible.

### You don't need programming skills to create a product

The next phase is to give shape to the idea.

As I told you at the beginning of this article, he does not have the skills to develop the product by himself.

He says, "You don't need any experience to build a mobile app"

So how does he build the app?

First, he sets up a Google doc and identifies all the ideas and features he wants in the app after researching competitors.

When looking at competitors or looking at companies that are making money in their niche market in the App Store, he says you should take note of all of their features, UI, etc.

This way, you will know what a good app looks like.

Product creation starts with a thorough take-down.

Then, take a piece of paper and start sketching the app.

Then, upload the sketches to a website called 99Designs.

Upload the sketch, explain the premise of the app, list the features, and say,

"Please bring my app to life"

Then 50, 60, sometimes 70 or more professional UI designers submit their ideas of what the app should look like.

At this point, a rough design is completed.

Then, based on the resulting UI, he moves on to development.

First, he searches for developers on Upwork.

At this point, the price will be changed according to the complexity of the app.

In the case of an app like Puff Count, which has only a few main features, he says it can be completed for less than $5,000.

He recommends hiring an Eastern European developer. He says they will deliver the best quality code for the lowest price.

I live in Eastern Europe myself, and there are indeed excellent engineers working for relatively cheap prices.

Once you choose a developer, you pay on a project completion basis, not by the hour.

He doesn't pay until the app is completed and published in the store without any bugs.

He has succeeded in developing apps without having to design and program them himself by procedures like this.

As for the selection of developers, he says that he conducts 15-minute interviews with good candidates to see if they bring more ideas for the app and if they seem excited about it.

After all, passion is the key to choosing the right person to work on a project with.

### How did he get more users for Puff Count?

So far, the product is complete.

Now how to attract users.

This part of attracting users is his specialty.

He says that 95% of the success of a mobile app is marketing.

He searched for vaping on Tiktok and saved all the viral videos in a spreadsheet.

He then analyzed the hooks, value, and how the content was shot to create videos similar to them.

Currently, [Puff Count's Tiktok account](https://www.tiktok.com/@puffcount) has over 120,000 followers and each video has tens of thousands to millions of views.

The most-viewed of these videos is below, which has been viewed 8.3 million times for a video that breaks down vaping.

I honestly have no idea what's so interesting about it, but after seeing a similar vape disassembly video get 20 million views, he made a disassembly video with a similar concept and it got 8.3 million views.

And in this video, he mentions Puff Count in the last 2 seconds. Until that time, there is no product pitch at all.

He also says that the app has been downloaded tens of thousands of times via this video.

Many people make their entire video about their product and fail.

No one wants to watch a sales pitch video on TikTok.

On his TikTok, he creates a hook with a funny video at the beginning and a call to action at the end with a simple 2-second sales pitch.

### 💰️How did he monetize it?

He've created a product and got to the point of attracting customers.

Now, how did he monetize it?

Puff Count is not a game, so it is not expected to be used for a long time.

Therefore, he adopted a user-charged subscription.

In Puff Count, users are first asked various questions related to vape.

Based on the answers to these questions, the user's problem level in various indicators is presented.

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*CmZ4ZLp-DKdsTiEa7jmmqw.jpeg)

If you want to improve these indicators, you can register for the application!

![None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*GqAP1mqoHhn3NSFumtXtNQ.jpeg)

The app is free for three days, and after that, it is priced at 1,500 yen($10) per week.

The price is made to look cheap by displaying it in one week. The actual monthly fee is a $40, which is a little expencive.

Some people may find the question before starting the application annoying, but he has done AB testing and found that the CVR was higher when the question was asked.

It would be a good move to incorporate this kind of diagnostic flow as part of the onboarding process for apps and services.

As for the price, he settled on the current price as a result of AB testing.

### Summary

Now that I have summarized Steven Cravotta.

It must be a dream for non-engineers to be able to create a product and generate solid revenue if you have an idea and are good at marketing, even if you cannot program or design.

Programming is only a means to an end.

Of course, there is nothing better than being able to program, but if you have an idea that you want to realize, there are plenty of ways to make it happen without having to learn programming yourself.

He also says that it is impossible to create a perfect product from the beginning.

When creating something new, it can never be perfect from the start.

Everything takes time to build up.

He has been with Puff Count for about four years, but he says it has only been in the last six or seven months that he has been able to generate a decent monthly income.

It takes time, commitment, and a willingness to learn.

So this time I have introduced Steven Cravotta. He is an amazing guy!

If you like, comment, and share, it will encourage me to continue!

See you next time!
