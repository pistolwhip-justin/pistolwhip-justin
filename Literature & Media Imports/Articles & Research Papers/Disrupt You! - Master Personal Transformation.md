Foreword 

When new users discover LinkedIn, most intuitively grasp that it offers a useful way for individuals to pursue jobs and provides a way for companies to recruit those individuals. But even today, not everyone recognizes—and thus not everyone truly capitalizes on—the larger capabilities that LinkedIn unleashes. 

When I first started talking about LinkedIn with Jay Samit in 2006, though, he got it. He understood that LinkedIn is more than an online résumé service and even more than a tightly connected distributed-trust recruiting tool. Jay recognized immediately that LinkedIn is a powerful network-intelligence platform—a way to build relationships, research competitors, learn best practices, surface new workplace trends, and ultimately identify opportunities. 

Now that I’ve read about the unique tactic Jay used to launch his career in the entertainment industry after graduating from UCLA in the early 1980s, I understand better why he grasped the full implications of LinkedIn so quickly. As you will discover when you read the anecdote yourself, Jay was already looking at the world through network-intelligence lenses at a time when most people still thought the only things that networks delivered were new episodes of Cheers and Dallas. 

Embracing innovation has always been a hallmark of Jay’s career. Whether creating the market for royalty-free digital stock photography or trying to get major record labels to adopt new digital distribution strategies, Jay has always looked toward technological disruption as a positive force. 

Instead of learning one way to do business, then settling into complacence, he has actively sought ways to create new markets; introduce new products, services, and operations; and broaden consumer bases. Instead of closing his eyes to change or simply trying to endure and survive it, he has responded to

shifts in the market with foresight and a mandate to make the most out of the new opportunities that disruption creates. 

And that’s the mind-set all professionals should aspire to now. In this networked era, new technologies introduce change at faster and faster rates. Tightly connected social platforms further accelerate and amplify these technological and economic shifts. Disruption is the order of the day—and it trickles down, reshaping industries, companies, and the careers of individual professionals. 

Whatever industry you’re in, the technologies that drive it are going to change. Your customers are going to demand new solutions. Your competitors are going to alter their tactics. To stay relevant, you must keep your career in permanent beta. That means committing to a lifetime of learning and professional growth, a lifetime of strategic adaptation. 

To successfully navigate today’s professional landscape, you must understand the dynamics of disruption. The currents of change shift more quickly and with more force now. If you’re not ready for these shifts, they’ll clobber you. But as Jay teaches in this book, you can learn to spot them early. You can swim with the currents of change instead of against them. And when you do that, disruption can propel you toward opportunities, creative challenges, and prosperity. 

—Reid Hoffman, November 2014

Introduction 

“Psst … What would you do with a million dollars?” the sexy disembodied voice would whisper to passersby. After stopping in his tracks and looking around, the surprised pedestrian would see a visual parade of yachts and race cars, mansions and glamorous women in evening gowns dancing across the kiosk’s twenty-inch screen. The year was 1984, and California was in dire straits. The country was emerging from a recession, and California’s unemployment rate was at an all-time high. Finally, and with much fanfare, it was decided that the troubled state would run a lottery, the revenues of which would generate the sorely needed funds for the state’s schools. A multi-million dollar contract would be awarded to the company that developed the best technology system for selling the new lottery’s tickets. My prototype kiosk with built-in motion detectors was going to be my ticket to fame and fortune. 

At the time, I was a twenty-four-year-old with a small multimedia company that did special effects and production work for hire. Our specialty was producing video games and interactive training programs on laserdisc. When the lottery was announced, I had a big idea: why not apply my expertise in the arcade video-game business to help the lottery become more interactive and fun? I partnered with Syntech, a lottery machine manufacturer that supplied ticketing hardware to create a player-activated terminal dubbed the PAT 2500. The PAT 2500 would actually talk to potential customers and encourage them to buy tickets. I outfitted the seventy-nine-inch-tall computer kiosks with laserdisc players, motion detectors, and speakers. The kiosk would beckon to anyone who came near it. Using Intel 8031 microprocessors, the kiosk was state-of-the-art. It’s hard to imagine this now, but in 1985 this rudimentary contraption was one of the very first commercial machines capable of handling audio and video. At the time, almost no one had a computer in their home or on their desk, and the

computers that were used in workplaces were shared by multiple users and had small, monochromatic displays. The PAT 2500 featured a twenty-inch full-color display and capacitive touchscreen. I was convinced that my machine and I were going to revolutionize the way lottery tickets would be bought and sold all over the world. At twenty-four years old, I was sure I had figured out how to become a billionaire. 

I was competing for the lucrative California Lottery contract against GTECH, who manufactured a primitive adding-machine-size unit that displayed greenish numbers on a black CRT. There was no comparison. I was sure my time had come. I was the young Turk disrupting the lottery industry! I was to the lottery what Henry Ford’s Model T was to horse-buggy makers! 

I was wrong. 

We weren’t awarded the contract. GTECH won the contract, and I was stuck with an amazing kiosk in my garage.1I was nothing more than a guy with big ideas; I was intent on changing the world, making a lot of money, and having fun along the way, but after I lost the lottery contract I was broke and dejected. 

With no lottery prospects, I spent the night before I was to fly home to Los Angeles from Sacramento tossing and turning. That night, thinking about who I was and how desperate I was to make my mark in the business world, I began what I would later come to call “self-disrupting.” I analyzed all the pieces that came together to form my identity. I began to define what unique experiences and knowledge I had that would set me apart from my peers. I thought about the way I made decisions, how I processed and responded to information, how I approached problems. I thought about the way I presented myself to the world and how I communicated my abilities to potential business partners and clients. And I thought about how I was spending my time and energy. If I was going to find opportunities to make a name for myself in the world, I was going to have to change something in my approach. Then I started thinking about my business in those same terms: Where was the value in my lottery machine? How could I put it to use in a different way? 

By the time I landed in L.A. the next morning, a subtle shift had taken place. When I arrived at LAX, looking for the cheapest way to get home from the airport, I stopped by the information booth to ask about shuttle times and services. Just my luck: no one was manning the booth, and there was no place in

the terminal to find shuttle or bus information. I realized, perhaps as a result of my previous hours of self-questioning, that this problem presented an opportunity. I started to think through my situation from every possible angle: How many of Los Angeles International Airport’s fifty million annual visitors shared this problem? How many hours a day were the booths manned, and at what cost? How many languages do visitors speak? Instinctively, I was deconstructing the size and scope of the opportunity while reassembling the strengths only I could bring to solving it. Who else had a prototype for a state-of the-art interactive kiosk in their garage? Twenty-four hours earlier, I had thought my big idea was interactive lottery kiosks, and now I knew I had been wrong. With one pivot I realized what my next business venture would be: automated airport information booths. 

I adapted the PAT 2500 into an airport information system that provided taxi, bus, and shuttle data in eight languages and even added an autodial phone (this was years before people had mobile phones) to connect the traveler with the dispatcher. By just touching the screen, visitors would be welcomed to Los Angeles by a friendly woman who spoke their language and could provide them with accurate information on how to cost-effectively get to more than five hundred local destinations. Within a couple of years my fledgling work-for-hire company had become LAX’s sole information service provider, putting in place the systems billions of travelers still rely on today. Just think about the last time you were at the airport: did you interact with a kiosk to print boarding passes, check luggage, or change your seat? The kiosk that disrupted the human ticketing agent was once a failed lottery machine. 

I was twenty-four years old, and from the ashes of failure I had risen to launch myself on a path of serial entrepreneurship—a path I’ve now been on for more than thirty years, and one that’s never let me down. 

* 

That early success was not an accident. It was the logical outcome of the introspective process I first implemented that night after finding out I had lost the lottery kiosk contract. I had always been creative, and I knew I wanted to make a splash in the business and entertainment worlds. I had lots of ideas, but I could never pull the pieces together to make my dreams happen. Like most

people, I didn’t know how to channel my ideas and energies into positive actions. Frustrated by my lack of progress, I reexamined my assumptions about myself and my personal skills. I came to refer to the intense and introspective process of questioning my beliefs and goals—which has, time and again, led to my biggest business breakthroughs—as self-disruption. Through self-disruption I have come to see that I can accomplish what I once thought impossible. I’ve discovered that if I am able to express any problem as a series of challenges, I can build a team capable of rising to those challenges. I have realized that businesses—whether they make dog food or software—don’t sell products; they sell solutions. Over the course of my career, my method of self-disruption has led me to work quickly and easily across entirely divergent industries— automotive, telecommunications, packaged goods, and quick service restaurants —changing the very nature of those businesses. I went from running a twenty person startup to being a global officer of an international company with over 160,000 employees. I’ve collaborated with Fortune 500 companies, foreign governments, and even the Vatican. In one year alone, I took stakes in more than twenty companies around the world (without investing a dime) and generated over $100 million profit. And best of all, I’ve never worried about job security or where my next big idea will come from, because I can always return to the techniques of self-disruption that have helped me transform myself and my businesses time and again. 

Businesses—whether they make dog food or software—don’t sell products; they sell solutions. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf1qRenpvIyOMR8IZQsHKF6hpDZ0-j8FU6FStd9_jmkLncmsFuDj8LHC0peT3glq8IXib7Yh5qHGhWrnn0q9U1IzxwUt5JmNXhmWBZa4k0nGQXBSMOcZh-fQn91lY-Z-yBld3lkyg?key=etLJXuA58Lnh7Vqq7NaKKmK1)

Over the past three decades, I’ve come to see that I’m not alone in the way I question my beliefs and find opportunity. History’s successful innovators have always employed aspects of this approach. Gutenberg’s ushering in of the Renaissance and the eventual democratization of knowledge wasn’t born from the invention of movable type, but rather from the way he deconstructed the value chain of surplus German wine presses, enabling him to invent the printing press. Magician Harry Houdini went from doing multiple performances a day in a dime show to being the most famous entertainer on the planet—not because he was the best prestidigitator, but because he disrupted the way entertainment was

mass-marketed. Nearly a century later, Canadian street performer Guy Laliberté would similarly deconstruct the value chain of the circus, disrupt the industry with Cirque du Soleil, dominate Las Vegas showrooms, and become a multibillionaire. 

Every successful disruptor employs one or more of these techniques to transform themselves, their businesses, and the world. They look internally, questioning their assumptions about themselves and reevaluating their unique talents. They put themselves on the path to success, even if they didn’t know what might lie ahead. And they understand that they cannot fall in love with their ideas, that they must be willing to destroy their concepts and pivot their energies before the market can render their businesses obsolete. 

All disruption starts with introspection. The way we understand our internal value chains—how we view ourselves and how we interpret our personal strengths—is at the core of all external success. I have applied these insights to raising over $800 million for startup companies as well as launching new businesses in billion-dollar industries as diverse as telecommunications, music, and ecommerce. I didn’t go to the right schools or know the right people, but I did learn how to disrupt my own belief systems in order to reposition myself to take advantage of opportunity and achieve success. And I’ve done it again and again—achieving resilience and security in an often unstable business landscape.

The self-made billionaire in his twenties, an unheard-of possibility a decade ago, now happens with regular frequency. The startup company, with little funding and a small staff, displaces hundred-year-old companies with billions in revenues virtually overnight. The consultant, with no background in technology or operating a business, makes millions of dollars from teaching one course online. The Arab Spring, which peacefully overthrew long-standing governments in Bahrain, Tunisia, and Yemen, is able to successfully force rulers from power without weapons or international support. The tightly interconnected world of the twenty-first century is exploding with new opportunities for personal empowerment and financial independence. What did all of these disruptions have in common? They were led by people who understood how to

analyze their internal value chains to pinpoint their unique talents and capabilities and then to analyze the value chains of their industries to find opportunities for disruption. 

Sir Richard Branson founded Virgin as a record store, only to discover that the real value was in creating, not just selling, records. The most successful serial disruptor in history, he has created billion-dollar companies in eight different industries. 

Lowell “Bud” Paxson deconstructed the value chain of his failing Florida radio station. When no one would advertise on his station, he bought surplus goods and sold them on air instead of running commercials. This idea was so successful that he transformed his local station into the billion-dollar retailing empire now known as the Home Shopping Network. 

A century ago, Joyce Clyde Hall was going broke selling penny postcards, until he killed his big idea that people wanted to write home to loved ones. His realization that most people can’t write led him to fill out the postcard for them. With the stroke of a pen he created Hallmark and launched the entire greeting card industry. 

A few years ago, the website Tune In Hook Up was designed by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim to disrupt the world of online dating. Most dating sites featured still images of prospective partners, but the former PayPal employees thought that showcasing dating videos would be much better. While the dating site was a failure, Hurley, Chen, and Karim realized that people really enjoyed watching the uploaded videos. Abandoning their original dating site concept, the team pivoted and renamed the site YouTube. 

The steps for disruption are not taught in college or business school. Yet every successful entrepreneur’s story, and decades of quantitative research, prove the validity of the techniques I describe throughout Disrupt You! It makes no difference whether your goal is to make millions of dollars or solve global warming, start a restaurant or a revolution. 

For years I have mentored entrepreneurs and aspiring students on how to disrupt. What I’ve discovered is that these techniques can be applied to virtually any field or endeavor. I truly believe that everyone can achieve personal success. Disrupt You! provides readers with instructions for self-disruption as well as the tools for applying the knowledge they gain to disrupt the business and

noncommercial worlds. This book is for all those willing to annihilate their assumptions in order to create a reimagined self. It’s a guide for those wishing to get more out of their jobs, careers, and lives. It can also be a guide for our world, as disruptors are the only ones capable of dealing with the macro issues affecting society at large and our planet as a whole. Disrupt You! reveals a new paradigm for breaking the patterns that limit personal success and growth by sharing actual case studies from dozens of the world’s most accomplished disruptors. 

Renaissance Florentine philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli said that entrepreneurs are “simply those who understand that there is little difference between obstacle and opportunity and are able to turn both to their advantage.” It’s this type of thinking that will lead to success in today’s world. 

You have a choice: pursue your dreams or be hired by someone else to help them fulfill their dreams. The great disruptors constantly reinvent themselves and their careers. They never fear losing their jobs, because they create jobs. They control their own destinies. This book is written to answer two very basic questions: How did they do it? How can I do it? The third question is entirely up to you: Will you do it?

Chapter One 

In Defense of Disruption 

The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking. 

—Albert Einstein 

In first-century Rome, an innovative glassmaker created vitrum flexile, flexible glass. Proud of his invention, he requested an audience with Emperor Tiberius. The emperor threw the drinking vessel down on the ground, but, much to his surprise, it did not shatter. At the time, all drinking vessels were made of gold and silver, which tainted wine with a metallic taste. Considering the glassmaker’s creation, Tiberius realized it would completely disrupt the Roman economy. If goblets were no longer made of gold and silver, the value of the precious metals would diminish immeasurably. Tiberius asked the glassmaker if anyone else knew the secret formula. When the inventor took a solemn oath that he alone knew how to create vitrum flexile, the emperor had the man beheaded. 

Today it is not so easy to thwart disruption. 

The business headlines will tell you that the world has become a scary place. Advances in 3-D printing that create just-in-time inventory threaten the jobs of 320 million manufacturing workers around the globe.1 Self-driving cars, trucks, and drones will displace tens of millions more workers. Renewable energy, such as solar photovoltaic cells, which have decreased in cost by more than 85 percent since the year 2000, will shift the geopolitical future of nations whose economies are supported by fossil fuels.2 According to a recent McKinsey Global Institute

study, the automation of knowledge work will have a $5 trillion to $7 trillion impact on white-collar jobs.3 Ecommerce and productivity gains in delivering retail goods are expected to further reduce the number of retail stores by as much as 15 percent.4 What is the real estate value of a mall, factory, or office building when its purpose is made obsolete? America’s workforce is now dealing with the realization that even though the recession is over, it has been a jobless recovery. This era of endless innovation has resulted in large multinational corporations shedding more than 2.9 million domestic jobs since the recession, and the pace of change is only accelerating.5It seems that whenever reporters, news anchors, pundits, and economists discuss this rapid pace of change, they throw around the word disruption—often employing the language of warfare—destruction and disorder. As generations-old companies and once valued brands and businesses are displaced by nimble, efficient new startups, we’re led to believe that disruptive new technologies have given the dogs in our dog-eat-dog world a powerful and violent strain of rabies. 

The disruption characterizing our current business landscape goes beyond innovation—and there is a difference between the two. Take the mighty sword, for example. Men have been fighting with swords for over five thousand years. Early bronze swords were lethally sharp, but, given the weak tensile strength of bronze, they had to be short in length. The innovation of steel and other alloys allowed the sword to grow in length, broadness, and societal importance. Skilled swordsmen became the defenders of kings and kingdoms, and the sword became the symbol of liberty and strength. Innovation therefore consisted of how each new culture and generation improved upon swords, changing how they were forged and how they were wielded in combat. But one of the great Hollywood adventure movies, Raiders of the Lost Ark, provides the perfect illustration of how disruption works. When Indiana Jones is challenged to a duel by an Arab swordsman flamboyantly waving his massive scimitar, Indy nonchalantly reaches into his holster, pulls out a revolver, and shoots the swordsman dead. With the presence of the pistol, the sword was made obsolete. Disruption is to existing businesses and business models what Indy’s Smith & Wesson was to the sword: it instantly changes the way the world functions and the course of history. 

Disruption is almost always led by a technological change. But disruption’s impact extends far beyond the technology industries. Eli Whitney’s invention of

the cotton gin in 1793 did more than just make cotton a profitable crop; it led to a quintupled growth in the number of slaves in the South and sparked the industrial revolution in the North. It catapulted a young nation’s economy and hastened the onslaught of the Civil War. Every American’s life was affected. History was altered by this one technological breakthrough. A technology or product is disruptive when it creates an entirely new market, consumer base, or user and destroys or displaces the market for the technology it replaced. Email disrupted postal mail, for example, and Wikipedia disrupted the traditional multivolume bound encyclopedia. 

Early in my career, I saw firsthand the difference between something that is truly disruptive and something that is merely innovative. When I launched my first company, Jasmine Productions, we were a small twelve-person operation doing small-time graphic and special-effects production work for hire. I was eager for an entry into mainstream Hollywood. At the same time, the Japanese electronics manufacturer Pioneer was also looking for an inroad. Pioneer had acquired control of a new home video format—the laser videodisc—from Philips and MCA (Universal Studios). Branded LaserDisc, the twelve-inch vinyl-record size platters had audio and video quality vastly superior to that of VHS and Betamax videocassettes, which were then popular with consumers for home video entertainment. The laserdisc player was marketed as a “record player that produces beautiful sound and pictures,” which could be enjoyed on your television. Laserdiscs were read by lasers and had no moving parts, as fragile videocassettes did, so the picture and sound quality would not deteriorate over time, nor would the discs jam or tear the way videotape did. Additionally, whereas videotape had to spool linearly through the entire tape to get to a different point, the lasers could instantly go from any point in the video to any other point, thus creating the possibility of “interactive video.” Stories could have different outcomes depending on which choice a viewer made. Unlike the linear narratives of movies and television, the laserdisc could combine the interactivity of video games with the production values of film. I was convinced this would revolutionize all forms of entertainment, and I wanted to lead this revolution. 

Pioneer Electronics needed developers to create consumer titles for this emerging field. The technology was so superior to videotape that I couldn’t see

how it could fail. I joined up with other filmmakers to work on Time Frame, the first interactive laserdisc title produced for the home, which Pioneer was going to distribute under its newly minted DiscoVision label. I felt like a rock star signed to a music label. We had dozens of ideas for interactive laserdiscs for kids and adults to enjoy. We planned to produce hit after hit. IBM and the Japanese electronics manufacturers had spent hundreds of millions of dollars inventing this new medium, and I was lucky enough to get in on the ground floor. I was going to be the king of the laserdisc and forever change home entertainment. I was sure the laserdisc would replace videocassettes the way television replaced radio after World War II. 

Unfortunately, after the first Christmas season, it became clear that because home consumers couldn’t use laserdiscs to record their favorite television shows, the way they had been doing with videocassettes, consumers saw the value of laserdiscs as being very limited. Our first major sales season was a bust. We knew we were going nowhere fast. The laserdisc’s only redeeming legacy was that its core technologies would become the basis for the more successful optical disc formats that followed over the coming decades: the CD and the DVD. As quickly as I had imagined how big the interactive video home market and my personal fortune were going to be, the sales never materialized, and Pioneer abandoned home entertainment. How could we have been so wrong? 

I learned then that there is a difference between failing and failure. Failing is trying something that you learn doesn’t work. Failure is throwing in the towel and giving up. I refused to be a failure. As Winston Churchill once said, “Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.” 

I learned then that there is a difference between failing and failure. Failing is trying something that you learn doesn’t work. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdYknzh27xnUJ2RoP_SFlUvw2ohR3kbs9UulEFjQMbEjDSgw720qFMEmMhzokc7elKNFMAE24BS0PcrknbKdtFHZBM5KU3E9AkaGIg-GQw29fHSAuxHpVkVHBfGPim1oOMRaqF_?key=etLJXuA58Lnh7Vqq7NaKKmK1)

I realized that the laserdisc hadn’t transformed home entertainment because the only new thing it offered customers was an improved experience. The laserdisc sought to compete on the playing field already established by the VCR. The VCR disrupted television viewing for an entire generation; laserdiscs were just an incremental improvement in visual quality. Laserdiscs were sold in the same sales channels, by the same salespeople, to the same consumer as

videocassettes. 

For a product or a process to be truly disruptive, it must create a new market and transform an existing business model. This realization launched my thirty year study of disruption. True disruption alters a market or system forever. The DVR, for example, didn’t just change how we watch television; it upended the entire advertising-supported television business model of the previous fifty years.

But just as early man progressed from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age to the Iron Age, each disruptive technology will itself eventually be disrupted. One hundred fifty years ago, the invention of the gramophone was disruptive. Because of the gramophone, mankind’s love of music became a mass media industry (a market was created), and for the first time in history, artists and musicians were able to amass great wealth from their craft (a new business model was launched). The gramophone meant that experiencing the musical talent of Enrico Caruso, the greatest tenor of his generation, was no longer restricted to just a few affluent patrons of opera. Common citizens developed a passion for music and could suddenly afford a library of popular recordings. Records were so popular with the masses that blues singer Bessie Smith became a millionaire in the 1920s. Eventually, through incremental improvements in recording and playback, the compact disc was born. The CD became the crowning technological innovation of the music industry, but it did not force any significant changes to the multi-billion-dollar business model. Artists still signed with labels, labels still produced and released albums, and consumers purchased the entire thing on a CD, just as they had once purchased a record. 

The $40 billion music industry was born of one invention—the gramophone —and comfortably relied on one business model for more than a century of profits. Then disruption came from another technology: the Internet. Disruptive digital services such as Napster, iTunes, and Spotify killed the mighty album, creating a market for single downloads; eviscerated the music labels’ revenue model; and shot the industry dead. One can argue about the inherent value of each incremental innovation in business, but the impact of disruption is

undeniable and unmistakable. In the wake of digital disruption, EMI—the hundred-year-old company that invented electric recording, the company that signed Caruso, the Beatles, and thousands of other artists—simply ceased to exist. 

In the twenty-first century, billion-dollar industries can be disrupted and waylaid virtually overnight—no sector of commerce or government is immune to the threat. 

For the record companies and recording artists disrupted by digital downloads and MP3s, for the postal workers and direct-mail businesses disrupted by email, for the newspaper and publishing executives disrupted by new advertising models like Craigslist and delivery platforms like ebooks and desktop self-publishing, disruption brings with it a sense of doom and gloom. We think of these businesses contracting and jobs being lost. But the truth is, wherever a business has been disrupted, volume is released. Massive opportunity is created and major shifts in economic wealth follow. Disruption creates opportunity. The railroads created railroad barons. The automobile created oil tycoons. Silicon Valley has created thousands of dot-com millionaires. Most people are surprised to learn that the richest man in Los Angeles is not a Hollywood celebrity, but a doctor who made over $7 billion by developing disruptive pharmaceuticals.6Identify the right trend or create the right startup, and billions of dollars could be yours. Anyone has the power to disrupt, and everyone has the opportunity to benefit from disruption. There has never been a time in history when upward mobility has been so equitably disbursed.

Yes, the pace of disruption has increased exponentially, thanks to a confluence of disruptive technologies that change how we work, communicate, travel, learn, and age. A century ago, having a few thousand customers for your product made you nationally known to America’s seventy-six million citizens. Now, over six billion potential consumers are just one click away from becoming customers. Cloud computing, wearable technology, 3-D printing, and the Internet of Things may just be abstract concepts to you today, but the impact they will

have on your career and fortune is inevitable. There are fortunes to be made by identifying and exploiting the smallest aspects of these seismic shifts in technology and business organizations. Executives at Gulf Oil didn’t have to know how to design or manufacture automobiles in order to recognize the growing demand for gasoline in 1913; they just had to satisfy the consumer’s needs, so they created the first drive-in gas station. Today the world spends $2.5 trillion consuming petroleum,7 and oil companies account for five of the world’s top ten revenue-producing companies.8 To financially benefit from technology changes, you don’t need an engineering degree or an M.B.A. To survive and thrive in the era of endless innovation, you merely need to think like a disruptor. 

FORGET THEORIES OF DISRUPTION 

Since Clayton Christensen coined the phrase “disruptive innovation” in his 1997 book The Innovator’s Dilemma, scores of academics and management consultants have studied a range of industries and companies in order to identify and classify various forms of disruption. Christensen asserts that there is a firm distinction between sustaining technologies and disruptive ones—think of the improving gas mileage of cars over the past thirty years as a series of sustaining technologies. But an electric car that doesn’t require gasoline: that would be disruptive technology. At first, disruptive technologies pose no threat to the entrenched technology because of poor performance. In the case of the first generation of electric cars, the mileage may be great, but the battery can’t get the vehicle from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. If Tesla, on the other hand, were to launch a $30,000 car with a thousand-mile range, then it would be game over for the combustion engine. 

Following in Christensen’s footsteps, an entire cottage industry of innovation experts have developed their own jargon for identifying and labeling disruptions. There are now more theories of disruption out there than we can count. Some focus on the most profitable high end of an existing market, while others examine how disruption works by encroaching on the low end.9 One theory holds that disruption starts at the fringe of existing markets by addressing unmet needs of new customers.10 Yet another focuses on price as its market force.11 My

favorite piece of modern management jargon is the technology S curve, which shows on a graph that new inventions grow slowly in the market, then have an explosive growth period, before gradually tapering off as they mature over time.12In other words, things start off small, get big, and then die off. My personal belief is that the technology S curve could be used to graph anything from the life cycle of the hard-drive industry to the life cycle of an oak tree. Every living thing grows and eventually dies. Everything. Knowing the S curve of the dinosaurs doesn’t help us understand why they disappeared or how mankind can avoid extinction. Neither can plotting the S curve of your product or company better prepare you for the inevitable. The management science of disruption has now reached its own maturation stage, as evidenced by the fact that the University of Southern California, where I am an adjunct professor, even offers an undergraduate degree in disruption! But the problem with all the theoretical approaches is that they are like the blood-spatter science used by Showtime’s Dexter Morgan: great for revealing what killed the victim, but worthless for predicting who will be slaughtered next. 

I prefer to leave the past to historians, anthropologists, and archaeologists. I believe most people want to know how they and their businesses are going to survive. And the truly motivated and bold want to know how they can thrive by becoming agents of change. The methodologies outlined in Disrupt You! are powerful because they are predictive and equip anyone to become a disruptor. 

I’ve had the luck and privilege of being at the center of some of the most disruptive trends of the past thirty years. From the birth of the personal computer and the launching of the commercial Internet to the creation of ecommerce, digital media, and smartphones, I have had a front-row seat, working alongside some amazing Davids who have upended some multi-billion-dollar Goliaths. Several times my colleagues and I partnered with the very companies our disruptions would eventually destroy. Disruption causes vast sums of money to flow from existing businesses and business models to new entrants. Disrupt You! is about entering the fray.

* 

When I was in my twenties and the personal computer industry was in its infancy, all the best and brightest minds I knew were imagining new uses for the home computer. PCs could balance checkbooks, word-process, make newsletters, play video games, format movie scripts, and be used for a host of other applications where typewriters couldn’t compete. Everyone saw that the PC had limitless potential, but no one had yet made significant money from this hobbyist endeavor. Just as every engineer today has an idea for a new smartphone app, scores of software companies were forming to compete for the potential billions this new disruptive industry promised. These new companies created software, circuit chips, motherboards, and myriad hardware components. Each firm was staking its fortunes on pushing the technical limits of what the primitive PCs could accomplish. Every day, new innovations and companies sprouted up like dandelions in summer. 

While technological developments create the opportunity for disruption, one doesn’t have to be a master of the new technology to reap the benefits. The young entrepreneurs of the 1990s were so desperate to find a way to cash in by improving upon the new technology—or trying to invent new gadgets and gizmos for the new technology to utilize—that they were investing in computer systems that cost more than the cars they drove. But which fledgling startup of the era was the first to sell for over $100 million? It wasn’t a software company. It wasn’t a hardware firm, either. In fact, my friend Billy Myers didn’t even know how to use a computer. But he was a born entrepreneur who recognized an opportunity created by disruption when he saw it. While other entrepreneurs were busy investing in complex computer systems, eager to create the newest, latest, greatest technological breakthroughs, Billy took a step back and analyzed what was happening around him. What he saw was people buying a $2,000 item for their home. His epiphany was dirt simple: something as expensive and valuable as a computer needed a dustcover. Who wouldn’t spend $10 to protect a $2,000 investment? Billy began making plastic dustcovers for monitors and central processing units (CPUs). He made dustcovers for keyboards and external hard drives. When he noticed people storing their software on dozens of little floppy disks, he made plastic cases and plastic file drawers. Consumers are using a mouse? Then they must have a plastic mouse pad. Billy was the first to identify

and create a personal-computer accessories market, and he eventually sold his company, MicroComputer Accessories, to Rubbermaid for a fortune. Billy’s success wasn’t born of inventing anything new; it was the result of his seeing opportunity created by disruptive technology and then seizing that opportunity. While Kaypro, Eagle, Franklin, Magnuson, Osborne, and dozens of other computer companies spent millions in their fight to capture a piece of the exploding PC market, one outsider identified where the most value could be captured the fastest in this new industry. (Decades later, when Apple unveiled the iPhone and launched a second generation of app developers scurrying to cash in, I smiled and watched as each customer lined up at the Apple Store to purchase a new expensive phone and, with it, a $30 plastic case. Most app companies spend millions of dollars competing for downloads and App Store placement, only to lose money and fail. Meanwhile, the iPhone accessories market quickly grew to a $16 billion business.) 

Billy’s story of producing and selling dustcovers, disk cases, and mouse pads at the dawn of the era of the personal computer is a perfect illustration of a beloved phrase of both sailors and coders: K.I.S.S.—keep it simple, stupid. While Billy was selling computer accessories, I realized I didn’t have the staff or funds to out-engineer the big guys. So I took a page from Billy’s book and looked for an opportunity in a part of the market others had overlooked. My goal was to capture as much value in the shortest amount of time possible. I wanted to generate profits that could fuel expansion into more costly product sectors. In layman’s terms, I wanted to get in the game, make some money with a simple product, and then reinvest my profits into better, more complex products. I also wanted to focus on a niche that had high margins with little existing competition. I was twenty-eight years old, and I had been running my workfor-hire technology production company for nearly seven years. I decided that the new technology of the CD-ROM offered me the opportunity I was looking for. I partnered with IBM—then the nation’s leader in computer sales—and licensed my product for IBM to ship and sell globally. My very first product, the Jasmine 6-Pack, came bundled with all IBM ActionMedia II PCs, sold for $1,500, and had a manufacturing cost of only $12. So where did I find opportunity for a 12,500-percent-profit-margin product that no one else had seen? Stock photography.

When computers went from having monochromatic screens with phosphorus-green text to featuring full-color, TV-like displays, I knew it wasn’t going to be long before users were going to want to see and use real photos on those screens. I realized that corporate brochures, newsletters, training software, and educational software all would require thousands of photographs of people, places, and things that could be incorporated into their products. I had worked at an advertising agency during college, so I was able to identify a need that most engineers wouldn’t have seen. As we will see in the next chapter, being successful as a disruptor is about applying your unique experience and viewpoint to find opportunity. 

My company’s new product focused not as much on how personal computers were disrupting technology as on how they were disrupting existing, non technology-related business models. At the time, whenever anyone needed a photo for something they were publishing, they had only two choices: hire a photographer or contact a stock photography agency. So if you needed a photograph of an elephant, either you could fly a nature photographer overseas and wait several weeks to get your image or you could call a stock photography agency. As primitive as it sounds, you would call the agency on the telephone and tell them you needed a photograph of an elephant by a river. The agency would overnight you a few dozen slides to choose from. The single-use licensing fee to use the image could range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. The process was slow, manual, inefficient, and very, very expensive. My solution was simple. 

I contacted stock agencies that didn’t understand or didn’t care about the PC. I quickly made a deal with PhotoBank for the rights to digitize 750,000 images from all around the globe. In addition to fantastic nature and travel imagery, PhotoBank had a huge collection of photographs of people doing every conceivable job or social activity. I licensed the images and put three hundred at a time, organized by theme or topic, on CD-ROM discs, agreeing to pay PhotoBank a royalty for each CD-ROM I sold. There were two unique aspects to my business model. First, anyone purchasing my software could use any or all of the three hundred images on the disc royalty-free. Companies that bought my

CD-ROMs could save tens of thousands of dollars a year and would have the legal right to use the images over and over again. Second, since I couldn’t fit the three hundred images onto a single disc at the highest possible resolution (i.e., the quality needed for magazine printing), my product wouldn’t cannibalize the stock agency’s existing business. Magazines and other professional print organizations would still have to go through the stock agency to get the high resolution images. My customers were individual users and small businesses that wanted to put pictures in brochures, in school papers, or on fliers they were creating on their new word processors. 

By becoming an IBM business partner, my company enabled its product to appear in IBM’s trade show booths and brochures, and we gained access to their thousands of customers. IBM opened doors for us, and my company experienced explosive growth for our products. With this steady revenue stream, we were later able to expand into other software products such as games and education. When the technology evolved and computers began playing sound and video, I started licensing music and video libraries to extend the wave without having to substantially change my initial business model. My startup became an established and recognized leader in the field. We had broad distribution and controlled valuable shelf space at retail. Building on our initial success and first mover advantage, Jasmine Multimedia Publishing eventually produced over three hundred CD-ROMs, ranging from video games to office productivity tools. And as soon as I realized that the advent of the Web meant the death of packaged software, I sold my company before we were disrupted—and focused all my energies on how I could use the Internet to disrupt other industries. 

THE DISRUPTOR’S PATH TO SUCCESS 

This success was not the result of my having invented a new technology. Instead, I used an existing technology to disrupt a different business. This, in the turbulent times of ceaseless technological transformation, is the secret to thriving as a disruptor. 

A business or product can be understood as the sum of its value-adding links. Traditionally, these links are thought of as research and development; design; production; marketing and sales; and distribution. Each of these disparate links contributes different value to the business as a whole. All products begin with

research and development. R & D defines what need the product fulfills and what functions it must possess. The product must then be designed and produced within the financial and material constraints available to the company. Marketing and sales focus on how to create and fulfill demand for the product. And lastly, distribution deals with the logistical issues of getting the product to consumers. Each link must be solid and sustainable if a product is to succeed, and each link can be disrupted by new entrants that are able to fulfill the same functions in a more efficient manner. A business is at risk for disruption when one or more of these links can be replaced by a technology or product that delivers improved services or additional value to a new market in a more efficient way. Let’s take the obvious example of mail. E-mail was able to disrupt the distribution link in the value chain of postal mail by enabling people to send messages to one another instantly and directly, rendering the postal service unnecessary in almost all matters of daily communication. 

But to thrive in the era of disruption, you don’t have to invent anything new. There’s no need to discover something the world has never seen before. Rather, there are riches to be found simply by capturing the value released through others’ disruptive breakthroughs. While email disrupted the distribution link in the value chain of postal mail, countless businesses have seen tremendous growth and profitability by using email to market, sell, design, and even produce other products. In other words, a disruption in one link in the value chain creates opportunity in other links. 

There are riches to be found simply by capturing the value released through others’ disruptive breakthroughs. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeEATJAtNy3hg3zsKnYcrOPvl0Fy-p0OCeVgGJN0wwPTfEVNWSWmFX0Gbw9teQVwkmp9FTaJGt7vTSCEYy6H-YW42IYu-KCe5b21eP-0HXma5xbw22KKoJW62cfu63T1sQE4s3EvQ?key=etLJXuA58Lnh7Vqq7NaKKmK1)

Anyone who takes advantage of the opportunities created by disruption, anyone who refuses to be intimidated by technological innovation, anyone who finds ways to continually reinvent themselves so that their unique assets will never become obsolete—these are the people I consider disruptors. 

Success as a disruptor is about capturing the value that is released through disruption. Every business will be disrupted sooner or later by technology. From the family restaurant that doesn’t know how to interact with OpenTable, Yelp, or Groupon to the mortgage broker made redundant by online loan originators such

as Quicken, you can either embrace the disruptor’s journey or become roadkill. In today’s business world, if you are not moving forward, you’re falling behind. The pace of change continues to accelerate, and therefore new opportunities abound. New entrants will replace old corporations that have survived on the momentum of milking every last dime out of established products instead of accepting the realities of cannibalization and championing disruption. As Kodak executive Larry Matteson said before the century-old company filed for bankruptcy, “Wise businesspeople concluded that it was best not to hurry to switch from making seventy cents on the dollar on film to maybe five cents at most in digital.” 

My first business success was in publishing CD-ROMs. It would have been easy to define myself as a CD-ROM publisher, but if I had, then when that industry disappeared, my career would have gone with it. Instead I see myself as a serial disruptor. I’m constantly looking for ways to apply new technological advancements to revolutionize how we work, learn, and play. I’ve run businesses in ecommerce, digital media distribution, social advertising, mobile apps, and crowdfunding. I’ve made a career out of capitalizing on the opportunities made available through disruptive technologies. I pride myself on knowing how to adapt when the rules of the game are changed; I refuse to be merely a pawn moved around the board. 

Though I spent the majority of my career as a startup entrepreneur, in each of my three “corporate” gigs (as senior management at Universal Studios, EMI, and Sony), I was brought in specifically as an intrapreneur. An intrapreneur disrupts from within the corporation, rather than waiting for the company to be attacked by external forces. At Universal Studios in the mid-1990s, I was tasked with finding ways to leverage the newly created World Wide Web to see if it could help market movies, sell music, book theme-park vacations, and generate new revenue streams. In the early aughts, I was president of EMI recorded music, where I had the dual challenge of combating the wave of Internet piracy launched by Napster and its descendants while migrating our revenue streams to digital downloads and streaming services. I was then hired by Sony—a company that for decades had been a leading innovator—to create a digital ecosystem for all the company’s disparate divisions: music, film, video, books, personal electronics, PlayStation, television, and computers.

When one is fully empowered, being an intrapreneur is the best job in the world. You have all the speed and agility of a startup, turbocharged with the financial and marketing muscle of a global corporation. You also get to pick your own team (which is so critical for building a successful business) and can afford to hire the best in the world. In each of my corporate gigs, I built new divisions to go after emerging market opportunities. Sometimes we were able to influence the overall corporate culture; other times we were treated like an ugly stepchild with Ebola. 

All three of my corporate stints allowed me to be a part of major industry during a time of great disruption. Unable to chart its own destiny as an independent entertainment company, Universal Studios has changed hands six times since the 1990s. EMI was acquired by a private equity firm for the record setting price of $4.7 billion,13 only to be cut up and sold piecemeal four years later.14 Sony, unwilling or unable to adapt to a changing digital landscape, lost nearly 90 percent of its value when the company went from a market capitalization over $100 billion in 2000 to $18 billion in 2012.15I have been both the victor and the vanquished. I have successfully disrupted markets dominated by IBM, Microsoft, Apple, and Google, and I have been disrupted by two college students in a dorm room. The lessons I learned from my rung on the corporate ladder influence Disrupt You! as much as what I learned from running startups. The truth is that corporate employees can no longer be immune to the entrepreneurial spirit. Incremental innovation is like walking on quicksand: it will keep you very busy but won’t get you very far. Building disruptive organizations must be infused into the DNA of every successful twenty-first century corporation. 

One of my favorite expressions is “Security robs ambition.” The majority of people are not willing to risk what they have built for the opportunity to have something better. Many professionals (including most of the middle-aged lawyers I know) have grown tired of their career but feel ensnared by their safe salary and comfortable routine. It is no coincidence that we refer to our accumulation of material goods as “trappings.” The longer you stay at a job you don’t like, the more money you will earn and the less likely you’ll be to leave to pursue your dreams. But the choice is always yours. Ask yourself, Would you rather work forty hours a week at a job you hate or eighty hours a week doing

work you love?

Most people were raised to believe in the so-called forty-forty life plan. Back in the era of stable corporations and fully funded pensions, employees worked forty hours a week for forty years and then retired. In the era of 401(k) plans and no pensions, working forty hours a week for forty years is not a formula for success. Twenty-three million Americans aged sixty or over are considered “financially insecure,” and one-third of senior households have no money left over each month or are in debt after meeting essential expenses.16 Worst of all, if one sees oneself as having achieved only a narrow band of experience at one company or in one field, what happens if that field goes away? While you are lamenting your “safe” position in life, someone else may be disrupting your entire industry and putting the company you work for out of business. Think your big corporate job is safe from disruption? Only seventy-one companies from the original Fortune 500 list published in 1954 remain on the list.17 Only 14 percent of the largest, most successful companies survived long enough for an employee to work his or her whole career at one company and retire.18 Security doesn’t rob ambition; the illusion of security robs ambition.

Disrupt You! examines how anyone can adopt a disruptor’s mind-set and set themselves on a disruptor’s path to success—whether that means starting your own business, proving your value at the company where you’re already employed, or rebranding yourself for career transformation. We will look at how successful disruptors identify opportunities created by disruptions in the value chains of other businesses, find big ideas, and know when to pivot their energies

and adjust their business models. Finally, Disrupt You! explores the ways various businesses and social organizations have recently been disrupted and predicts which links in their value chains are ripe for future disruption. 

According to USA Today, 50 percent of today’s college students want to be entrepreneurs.19In addition to students, countless other workers dream of being their own bosses, creating their own small businesses, or even just making more money. Dozens of business incubators are sprouting up all around America. In 1980, there were only twelve incubators in the entire nation; today there are over 1,250, and that number is estimated to grow by 10 percent per year.20 As I travel around the country speaking at incubators, I encounter first-time entrepreneurs thirsty for practical advice on how to transform their industries and make constructive change. Even in these tough economic times, many Americans quit their jobs last year because they wanted more from their lives than a paycheck.21 They want to make a difference. Disrupt You! isn’t just for startup entrepreneurs or corporate employees; it is for everyone looking for a promotion, a raise, or a way to get more satisfaction out of their lives.

Chapter Two 

Become a Disruptor 

Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself. 

—Leo Tolstoy 

Being a disruptor is simply a state of mind. It is the ability to look for opportunity in every obstacle, to respond to every setback as a new beginning. It is being in the silver-lining business. Every successful person who has skillfully transformed a business or social organization started with a personal problem and then noticed how many other people shared the same problem. What sets disruptors apart from other people who merely experience problems is that disruptors see themselves and their worlds differently. That unique viewpoint enables them to become agents of change—and to reap the rewards. Disruption isn’t about what happens to you; it’s about how you respond to what happens to you. 

Disruption isn’t about what happens to you; it’s about how you respond to what happens to you. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfcAStPdfe7Ax0U94Lba1v1pCrtuQ0QOMzCTMzykA8foaydDdOPYEmoN9GJo7vRGtHT8PQNjxsl7dbF-A9xaxkpleOgSavGdhQrJMM_-6xxYaYVPSidwK-Ryx7Vq01YqzcKp_SEWA?key=etLJXuA58Lnh7Vqq7NaKKmK1)

Every road warrior has experienced the misery of missing a connecting flight and feeling helplessly stranded at some faraway airport. But when this happened to legendary entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, he responded differently. In 1979, when the twenty-nine-year-old music executive missed his flight to Puerto Rico from the British Virgin Islands, he looked around the airport and added up

in his head how many other travelers were also stranded. He quickly chartered a plane and wrote on a blackboard VIRGIN AIRWAYS $39. Everyone got to where they wanted to go. But Sir Richard and his fiancée, Joan, got to fly for free. For Sir Richard, starting what would become a billion-dollar airline really was as easy as missing a flight. Disruptors recognize that the problems they’re facing are probably happening to others as well. 

While still in college, Jenn Hyman watched as her frustrated sister Becky experienced a dilemma familiar to nearly all women: having “a closet full of clothes but nothing to wear.” Becky’s desire to look fabulous for a friend’s wedding couldn’t be fulfilled on her modest salary. She wanted to wear a high end designer dress from Hervé Léger or Proenza Schouler, even if just for one night. That’s when Jenn came up with a simple disruptive idea: what if there was a dream closet where women could rent the latest designer fashions, affording them a new dress for every occasion? Jenn partnered with her Harvard Business School classmate Jenny Fleiss, and Rent the Runway was born. “Our intention is to disrupt every single part of what retail has meant historically,” Jenn remarked recently in a Forbes interview.1 And disrupt they have. With nearly $55 million in venture capital funding, Rent the Runway now employs more than two hundred people, ships dresses and accessories to women around the world, and is challenging the way New York’s top designers and department stores do business.2 

While Jenn and Jenny were launching their empire, most American college students were drowning in debt. American college graduates now owe over $1 trillion in student loans.3 An entire generation is carrying the burden of a mortgage without the advantages of owning a home. Attorney Gene Wade looked at this massive problem and created a simple but disruptive solution: an affordable online degree. Unlike other digital schools, Wade’s UniversityNow provides students with an all-you-can-eat model for as little as $2,600 a year.4 The bargain pricing includes all books and tuition for fully accredited degrees ranging from undergraduate degrees to M.B.A.’s. “I became an education entrepreneur because the current system does not have the capacity to serve people with unique higher-education needs,” Wade says. With over $42 million in venture funding, UniversityNow is well positioned to disrupt the business of higher education and free future generations from unmanageable debt.5 Wade is

a man on a mission, with big, bold dreams. 

What Sir Richard Branson, Jenn Hyman and Jenny Fleiss, and Gene Wade have in common is the mind-set of the disruptor. Rather than observing a problem and sitting back and waiting for others to solve it, they jumped in headfirst, seeing massive problems as massive opportunities. To adopt the mind set of a disruptor, you must first disrupt yourself. 

THE ART OF SELF-DISRUPTION 

In the previous chapter, we saw how disruption occurs when a link in the value chain is entirely transformed by the introduction of a new technology or product —one that creates a new market demand and forces an overhaul of the previous business model. I suggested that a disruptor is not necessarily the inventor of a revolutionary new product, but can be anyone who seizes the opportunities created at other points in the value chain of a business when one link has been disrupted. In this chapter, we will explore how you can analyze and disrupt the links in your personal value chain to unlock your potential and prime yourself to seize opportunity. 

“The mind is everything. What you think, you become,” Buddha wrote two millennia ago. Your self is nothing more than what you believe it to be. You must remove all the internal and external definitions of self that limit your progress in life. 

Self-disruption is not a comfortable or easy process. It requires you to get out of your comfort zone. As trite as it sounds, think of the painful and time consuming metamorphosis a caterpillar must endure in order to emerge as a brilliant butterfly. Self-disruption is akin to undergoing major surgery, but you are the one holding the scalpel. A search for “self-help” on Amazon yields over 400,000 volumes on getting out of your own way, achieving your dreams, and re-creating your life from the inside out. I am sure each of these books is filled with lessons on healing your emotional self and building self-esteem. I am not a psychologist, and I am the last person on earth who should give advice about eternal happiness or spiritual awakening. But I am an expert on deconstructing a set of assumptions so as to disrupt a problem and thereby create new

opportunity. 

Self-disruption is akin to undergoing major surgery, but you are the one holding the scalpel. 

Just as every company has a value chain that defines a business’s success, we can think of our own identities as being formed by our internal value chains. Our internal value chains make us who we are; they guide the way we function in the world. Our research and development center takes input from our environment and perceives it as either an obstacle or an opportunity. The brain, our design and-production center, dictates actions in response to our perceptions. We market and sell ourselves in the ways we present ourselves to the world, which are based on what we see as our personal strengths or limitations. We distribute ourselves in the ways we choose to spend our time and where we focus our energies. When viewed from this framework, the process of self-transformation becomes approachable: you need only analyze each link in your internal value chain and find the single link that’s holding you back. Then make changes to that link to disrupt yourself. 

DISRUPTING YOUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LINKS 

In 1948, UCLA psychologist Bertram Forer proved how malleable human self perception could be with a famous experiment. Dr. Forer instructed his class to complete a very detailed personality assessment test. He then provided each student with a unique personality analysis based on his or her answers. The students were asked to rate the accuracy of the analysis against their own self perception. Forer’s test has been administered to thousands of students for more than half a century, and it continues to average a 4.26 accuracy rating from participants, on a scale of 1 to 5. With an accuracy rate better than 85 percent, it is perhaps the most meticulous measuring tool for human personality traits ever constructed. There is just one problem with Forer’s test: it is a hoax. Every student, regardless of how they answer the questions on the assessment test, is provided with this identical analysis:

You have a great need for other people to like and admire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others’statements without satisfactory proof. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Security is one of your major goals in life. 

No matter how participants answered the questions, Forer gave them all the same feedback, saying he was analyzing their unique personalities—and 85 percent of the time, participants said that Forer’s assessment described them accurately.6If our identity is so easily influenced by external sources, then we must have the ability to alter our mind-set. Think about how Forer’s personality test might apply to you. The external voices in our lives become the research and development links in the value chain that makes us who we are. When in your life have you started to believe those voices? What have they told you about yourself? How are they holding you back? 

I was not supposed to be successful when I grew up. (Just ask any of my relatives.) As a small child, I had difficulty learning to speak and read. When I entered elementary school, they divided all the students in my class into three reading groups: the Eagles, the Hawks, and the Mud Hens. I was a natural-born Mud Hen. Even at five years old, you know when the teacher is putting you in the loser group. Eagles soar, while Mud Hens sit in the corner and play with clay. I couldn’t learn like the other children and was convinced by teachers that I was stupid. Years later, after some testing, my parents and teachers would discover that I was dyslexic.

When I was a child in the 1960s, dyslexia was not viewed as a gift; it was a learning disorder. Schools either put dyslexic students in special education classes or moved us to the back of the classroom. Labeling students as different sets them down a path of believing that they are less than their peers. Everyone can relate to being different at one time or another in school. We have all been told repeatedly what talents we’re lacking. You’re bad at math. You can’t read a map. You have no artistic ability. You will never understand how to run a business. Repeated frequently enough by parents, teachers, and role models, these opinions become internalized by children. Over time, most people accept the limitations conferred on them by society. 

Luckily for me, the sixties were a time of new and experimental education theories. The United States was racing to the moon, and academia was breaking with the past. The era of rote memorization was giving way to individual self expression. Teachers began trying new things in the classroom. Students like me were given the choice to write an essay or draw a picture. Take a spelling test or gather a bagful of things that started with the “sm” sound, such as Smurfs or smiles. I put Saran Wrap over the head of my sister’s Barbie doll for “smother” and got both a gold star and a trip to the school psychologist. 

I managed to make it through elementary school masking my learning “disorder” by developing creative work-arounds to compensate for my inability to do things the way everyone else did. I’d rather give a show-and-tell talk in front of the whole class than write a report. Given the choice of working on an assignment by myself or creating a team project, I would always opt for the team, where I could delegate the tasks I wasn’t good at. Not able to compete on a level academic playing field, I learned to invent new ways of circumventing the system to mask my inability to read or write at the level of my peers. By fifth grade I had adapted my world to fit my skills and was getting straight As. In retrospect, working around the established system to survive was the ideal training ground for an autonomous disruptor. I was disrupting my traditional education from a very young age. 

Turns out I wasn’t the only dyslexic disruptor. Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Sir Richard Branson, Leonardo da Vinci, Michael Faraday, Henry Ford, Ted Turner, and Walt Disney were all dyslexic. They all complained of being bored in school and were thought by

educators to be unmotivated. So many great disruptors across so many divergent fields are dyslexics that it can’t be statistically accounted for as a coincidence. In the military, George Washington and General George S. Patton, two of the most creative strategists on the battlefield, were dyslexics. Status-quo-challenging artists such as Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol “suffered” from this gift as well.7 Could there actually be an advantage to thinking this way? 

Steve Jobs, in his brilliant commencement address to Stanford University’s class of 2005, reflected on his academic challenges in college. Jobs knew he wanted to achieve something great when he set out on his life path, but he didn’t know what steps would lead him to success. 

Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something—your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.8 

Like most dyslexics, Jobs was bored in class. He dropped out of Reed College after a semester. But rather than go home, Steve dropped in on classes he thought might capture his imagination. One was a course in calligraphy. Years later, when designing the Macintosh computer, he drew on that experience to create the first personal computer with multiple typefaces. When graphic artists gravitated to the Mac, Jobs realized that his fledgling company had found its first niche market. Desktop publishing was born, and Windows PCs soon followed suit. Jobs audited one random college class, and the entire role of computers in society was transformed. 

In recent studies on identical twins at the Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, behavioral geneticists concluded that the personal interactions twins had with their environment actually remapped their brains. A feedback loop develops as new behavior is positively reinforced, and in the end, two identical twins can develop radically different personalities. The child who makes more sounds gets spoken to more frequently. Over time, this child will develop more

verbal connections in his brain as a result of the positive reinforcement he receives from his environment. The study found that the twin who gets less attention grows up to be introverted and less verbal.9 On a daily basis, we adapt in response to our environment. 

When Mohandas Gandhi was studying law in London, his ideas were not widely followed or accepted. Upon returning to India, Gandhi changed his environment and lived among the people, and only then did his new self perception emerge. In his book for entrepreneurs, The Startup of You, LinkedIn cofounder and super angel investor Reid Hoffman put it this way: “Identity doesn’t get found. It emerges.”10 

From a very young age, we are taught to believe that we have immutable limitations. Parents, teachers, and coaches praise or criticize us. With IQ tests and school entrance exams, we are judged and scored. As adults, we might have a career counselor administer the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaire to tell us what kinds of careers we are best suited for. 

Life experience is often a continuous research and development funnel that narrows our goals and results in our limiting the opportunities we think are open to us. We temper our ambitions based on the feedback we receive from those around us. Are you an extrovert or an introvert? Do you rely on intuition or rational thinking to make decisions? The unfortunate reality is that what holds most people back is actually their own beliefs that they are not good enough or deserving enough to be successful. 

So much of the research and development we do on ourselves begins very early in life. We design our persona based on the feedback we get at home and at school. Students who are told they are smart actually do better in school. Kids who are told they are gifted at sports actually grow up to become better athletes. This phenomenon has been proved over and over again in clinical studies; Columbia University sociologist Robert K. Merton called it the Matthew Effect, after the biblical passage, “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.”11In other words, you get what you believe you deserve. 

You get what you believe you deserve.

In his bestselling book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell recounts Canadian psychologist Roger Barnsley’s study of professional hockey players. As statistically impossible as it seems, the most successful athletes in the National Hockey League were most likely to have been born between January and March. The reason was the Matthew Effect. 

“It has nothing to do with astrology, nor is there anything magical about the first three months of the year,” Gladwell writes. “It’s simply that in Canada the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1. A boy who turns ten on January 2, then, could be playing alongside someone who doesn’t turn ten until the end of the year—and at that age, in preadolescence, a twelve-month gap in age represents an enormous difference in physical maturity.”12 

So the older, larger children excelled at hockey, and their parents and coaches reinforced this by telling them that they were good at hockey. Getting praised for being good at something made the sport more enjoyable to the children. The more approval the children received, the more they enjoyed the game, the more time they spent practicing, and the better they got. This positive reinforcement was not only internalized into the children’s identities but hardwired into their brains. The children developed superior hockey minds. The slight biological advantage that they had when they first hit the ice at age ten propelled these players toward mastery and a profession in hockey. When children born in January through March turned pro, they joined a league dominated by players sharing their first quarter birthdays. We become what we believe we are. 

The same is true for how women perceive their roles in society and the workplace. If girls are called bossy whenever they are assertive, are they less likely to develop into outgoing adults? In Sheryl Sandberg’s book on women and the workplace, Lean In, she points out that “we cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change.”13 

DISRUPTING YOUR DESIGN AND PRODUCTION LINKS Dr. Sally Shaywitz, who teaches at the Yale University School of Medicine and is codirector of the Yale Center for Dyslexia & Creativity, has devoted her career to studying dyslexia. Her research provides a scientific basis for reclassifying dyslexia as a learning gift instead of the malady I was raised to believe it was. Dyslexic brains are physiologically hardwired to solve problems differently.

Using fMRI scanners, Shaywitz has identified in dyslexic readers “a neural signature for dyslexia” that is a disruption of the two neural systems in the brain’s posterior. Dr. Shaywitz’s research shows that dyslexic brains are actually wired differently. 

“Brain imaging now provides visible evidence of the reality of dyslexia,” writes Shaywitz. “Dyslexia is no longer a hidden disability.”14 Dyslexics tend to see problems in their totality; we actually process problems outside of a linear set of steps and draw conclusions from unrelated associations. Dyslexics’ ability to see the big picture enables them to swiftly analyze a business’s points of potential value. For example, Ted Turner was able to see value others couldn’t in the old MGM film library and launched new revenue streams in the emerging world of cable television. Dr. Shaywitz refers to the higher critical thinking and creativity associated with dyslexia as a “Sea of Strengths.” How fascinating that dyslexic Steve Jobs’s most effective advertising campaign for Apple was “Think Different.” 

Virgin Group founder and chairman Sir Richard Branson personally credits dyslexia as his “greatest strength.” 

“Back when I was in school, few people understood dyslexia and what to do for it,” Branson explains. “On one of my last days at school, the headmaster said I would either end up in prison or become a millionaire. That was quite a startling prediction, but in some respects he was right on both counts!”15 

Common traits in the sea of strengths that the dyslexic entrepreneur brings to the business world are critical thinking, out-of-the-box problem solving, tenacity, and higher intelligence. A groundbreaking study of the links between entrepreneurs and dyslexia conducted by the Cass Business School, in London, found that 35 percent of U.S. business owners surveyed identified themselves as dyslexic.16 The study, led by Cass professor of entrepreneurship Julie Logan, identified that dyslexics were more likely to delegate authority and excel in oral communication. Much as I did in school, most dyslexics compensated for weakness in one area by building strengths in another. “We found that dyslexics who succeed had overcome an awful lot in their lives by developing compensatory skills,” according to Cass. “If you tell your friends and acquaintances that you plan to start a business, you’ll hear over and over, ‘It won’t work. It can’t be done.’ But dyslexics are extraordinarily creative about

maneuvering their way around problems.”17 

The way our brains process and respond to information can be thought of as the design and production links in our internal value chains. Just as a business can transform itself by changing the way it designs and produces its products, you can remap your neural networks to actually think differently. You have the power to alter the physical hardwiring of the connections in your brain. How you choose to think changes how the brain processes information. For example, recent studies have shown that positive thinking is more than a motivational tool; it actually adapts our physiology.18 

It is possible to rewire your brain to comprehend and problem-solve as if you were dyslexic. Don’t let yourself dwell on problem solving as a series of discrete steps. Train yourself to look outside the given variables and see the big picture. Don’t try to see the steps to solving a problem; first visualize the solution and then work backward to determine what you will have to do or build to get to that solution. By thinking this way, you will discover the shortest path, the minimum steps required, and identify all the missing pieces to solve the puzzle. An entire industry has developed around teaching people and institutions to think holistically like this. London-based Innovation Arts is a consultancy that uses “visual facilitation” to change the way corporate teams communicate, design, and develop new products and ideas, with clients ranging from British Telecom to financial services firm Swiss Re. 

Professional athletes practice the same moves over and over again to develop muscle memory. “I have been visualizing myself every night for the past four years standing on the podium having the gold placed around my neck,” said Megan Jendrick, a two-time Olympic gold-medal-winning swimmer, when asked about how she performs so consistently.19 An athlete’s body instantly knows how to react to any given situation, because they have rehearsed it and drilled it into being. Visualizing success is no different. 

Cognitive neuroscientist Antti Revonsuo has dedicated his career to studying the role of dreams in humans. His lab work at the University of Turku, in Finland, and the University of Skövde, in Sweden, has shown that the part of the brain called the amygdala is most active when we are in the REM stage of sleeping. The amygdala controls our emotions, and this explains why our dreams feel so emotionally real to us. We are actually scared when being chased in a

dream. Our brain does not distinguish between reality and a dream when we are sleeping. Revonsuo also discovered that the part of our brain that controls our limbs’ motor functions (climbing, running, bracing for a fall) is engaged during REM.20 The brain is teaching the body how to react, even though our arms and legs are not moving. Revonsuo concluded that we dream in order to rehearse real-world behavior. Our dreams condition us to respond much the way the athlete conditions her body. 

Our dreams condition us to respond much the way the athlete conditions her body. 

By taking just five minutes each morning to visualize success, you train your brain to accept that you are capable of handling success. By visualizing each step of your journey, you are actually getting your mind prepared to handle the opportunity. 

“The mind is really so incredible,” says former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. “Before I won my first Mr. Universe title, I walked around the tournament like I owned it. I had won it so many times in my mind, the title was already mine. Then when I moved on to the movies I used the same technique. I visualized daily being a successful actor and earning big money.”21 

The second benefit of starting your day with visualization is how good it will make you feel. A negative mind will never find success. I have never heard a positive idea come from a person in a negative state. As you will discover in later chapters, success is merely turning obstacles into opportunities: the bigger the obstacle, the greater your potential for success. In World War II, the German Blitzkrieg (“lightning war”) was a seemingly unstoppable ground-and-air assault. The Nazis launched columns of panzer tanks to quickly dominate Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. After the Allied forces landed at Normandy, few in our military had any idea how to defend against the dreaded Blitzkrieg. At the time, General Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed to his generals, “The present situation is to be regarded as opportunity for us and not disaster.”22 With that spirit in mind, the Allies realized that the Blitzkrieg left the sides of the advancing column’s flanks exposed, sending fifty thousand German troops into a trap. Eisenhower visualized the victory in his mind and then shared

his vision with those under his command. This one positive approach to an obstacle turned the Battle of the Bulge into a major victory. 

A negative mind will never find success. I have never heard a positive idea come from a person in a negative state. 

Think of the way you approach problems and react to the world around you as the design and production links in your internal value chain. Where can you find opportunities in your life to design and produce different responses? How would incorporating visualization or changing the way you think transform the way you live? 

DISRUPTING YOUR MARKETING AND SALES LINKS Not knowing what to do with me when I was a toddler, my mother forged the date on my birth certificate so that I could be sent off to school an entire year early. Throughout elementary school, I was the smallest and least coordinated. I was awful at sports and was always the last kid picked to join teams. I learned to hate athletics and completely avoided anything having to do with physical activity. I became what I believed. Even today, I am one of the few adults I know who doesn’t follow or watch any professional sports. I had internalized the belief that I couldn’t succeed at sports and therefore adapted my goals to conform to the world’s view of my identity. 

But when I turned forty, I decided to confront my self-identity of being uncoordinated and horrible at sports. Thanks to a doctor’s note that got me out of PE class starting in the seventh grade, I hadn’t participated in any athletic activities since I was twelve. I was an obese, two-hundred-pound middle-aged guy who was out of breath after walking up a short flight of stairs. As I raced around the world through airports huffing and puffing, I realized I had become a heart attack waiting to happen. Thinking about this in terms of my internal value chain, I saw that my marketing and sales links were ripe for disruption. I was presenting myself to the world as an out-of-shape, intimidated middle-aged man. That needed to change. 

I sought out a mentor. Working in my department at the time was Kenny Johnson Jr., who was training for the U.S. Olympic wrestling team. I asked

Kenny for a list of exercises and repetitions that could get me into shape. I committed to doing the routine twice a week. The first day it took me three hours, and I was so wiped out that I had to lie down for the rest of the day. Within three weeks, the same routine took just forty-five minutes. The second month, I added in two miles on the treadmill once a week. After six months, I weighed 165 pounds, could do two dozen pull-ups, and was able to run four miles. 

With a new sense of identity, and having overcome the limitations ingrained in me since I was four years old, I decided to pursue a fantasy goal of mine: I learned how to trapeze. I was nearly twice the age of most of the other aerial performers, but I soared through the air with twice the sense of joy. I had disrupted the marketing and sales links in my internal value chain, and I changed my body by changing my mind. 

Mark Zupan, a former professional athlete, similarly refused to be defined by what others saw as limitations. After a car crash confined him to a wheelchair, the former football and soccer player focused his energy on wheelchair rugby. “Breaking my neck was the best thing that ever happened to me,” Zupan says. “I have an Olympic medal. I’ve been to so many countries I would never have been, met so many people I would never have met. I’ve done more in the chair … than a whole hell of a lot of people who aren’t in chairs.”23 The way we market and sell ourselves should not be determined by what others perceive of us. Our lives and careers are determined by our acceptance or rejection of our perceived limitations. 

DISRUPTING YOUR DISTRIBUTION LINK 

Sara Blakely wanted to be a lawyer, but she failed the LSAT test required to get into law school. Reflecting on that experience years later, she said, “I think failure is nothing more than life’s way of nudging you that you are off course.”24 

Blakely took a sales job in Florida to pay the bills, but she knew that if she was going to achieve success, she would have to focus her real energy in a different way. Required to wear panty hose at her job, she hated how the seamed

foot looked in open-toed shoes. She cut off the toes and realized that the toeless panty hose could be marketed as a new product. Though she wasn’t trained as a fashion designer, prototype maker, or sales executive, she was determined to bring her product to market. Blakely went to hosiery mills and major retailers, and at both places her business card was ripped up in her face. Not having the funds to hire a lawyer to patent her creation, she went to Barnes & Noble and bought a book on how to write your own patents. She tirelessly devoted all of her free time to building her company, which eventually made her a billionaire and made Spanx a world-renowned brand name. Her advice to others going through the self-disruptor process: “Don’t be intimidated by what you don’t know. That can be your greatest strength and ensure that you do things differently from everyone else.”25 

The last link in the internal value chain is distribution, which can be thought of as how we choose to spend our time and where we direct our focus. Think about the way you spend your days and nights. Are you devoting the time and energy necessary to achieve your dreams, or do you find yourself channel surfing on the couch every night after work? 

One of the most common excuses people give for not pursuing their goals is lack of time. “If only I had the time to study a new field or learn a new profession” is the lament of every dissatisfied person struggling to juggle work and family. But the most successful people have the same twenty-four hours in a day that you do. The only difference is that they take control of their time. Think about where you can find additional time. What daily indulgences might you be willing to give up in pursuit of your dreams? Why not take the next step and enroll yourself in “Traffic University,” like my friend Ed Gartenberg did. Committed to lifelong learning, Ed listens to audiobooks in his car. He drives an average of twenty-five thousand miles a year commuting to downtown Los Angeles from the San Fernando Valley suburbs. With rush hour traffic averaging twenty miles an hour, Ed spends more than twice as much time each year learning than the average full-time college student spends in the classroom. Not only is Ed continuing to learn and achieve his goals, but he’s transformed the frustration of gridlock into a mobile sanctuary of knowledge. Each morning, he looks forward to his commute and has built up such a vast knowledge of history at Traffic U that he has made plans to pursue an actual university Ph.D. in

history when he retires from his law practice at age sixty-seven. 

The most successful people have the same twenty-four hours in a day that you do. 

Taking a page out of Ed’s Traffic University, I realized that I wasted over three hundred hours a year in the air flying. Now, instead of dreading the lost time in flight, I’ve begun to look forward to my time in the sky, where no one can interrupt me with emails, texts, or calls. 

But “if you want something done,” comedienne Lucille Ball used to say, “ask a busy person to do it. The more things you do, the more you can do.”26 A dream with a deadline is a goal. 

A dream with a deadline is a goal. 

Your energy is a valuable resource: distribute it wisely.

Think about yourself in terms of your personal value chain. The research and development links are all the various ways you interpret the world around you. Where do you thrive best—in an office environment or in a more independent and creative setting? What type of people do you work with best? What do you believe about yourself that might not be true? How can those self-assumptions be annihilated? Seeing environmental influences as nothing more than links in the chain that make you who you are, you are empowered to make the changes necessary to become who you want to be. 

The next links in the chain are production and design. What emotions and actions are produced when you’re confronted by a challenge or problem? Do you feel frustrated or defeated, or can you change the way you think so that you can tackle problems with an open mind, thinking holistically? How do you react in stressful situations like getting a new boss at work? Do you worry that you’ll have to prove yourself all over again to keep your job, or do you view it as an

opportunity to get the promotion you think you deserve? The environmental stimuli are the same, but your reaction and resulting actions are completely different, depending on your mind-set. 

So much of self-disruption is making deliberate choices in your life instead of running on autopilot. We’ve all walked into a large conference or meeting without knowing a soul in the room. The fight-or-flight response from your autonomic nervous system pumps you full of adrenaline, causing your heart and respiratory rate to increase. Consciously take yourself off autopilot. It is not ten thousand years ago—no Neanderthal is going to kill you. Realizing that everyone feels the same way you do, why not turn this into an opportunity to greet others and make them feel welcome and safe? By following this approach to all your challenges, you will quickly see that success comes not from circumstances beyond your control, but from the way you respond to those circumstances. 

Disrupting the next link in your personal value chain involves analyzing how you market and sell your potential. Not your skills or accomplishments, but your limitless potential. Most people, when applying for a job or raising money for their startup, focus their energies on explaining what they have achieved in the past. Success is all about championing and defining the future. As Henry Ford was fond of saying, “Whether you think you can or think you can’t—you’re right.” 

Finally, think about how you distribute your time and energy. Are you in a position where you have to spend hours doing things you hate? Could you devote more time to educating yourself so that you can pursue the job of your dreams? Could you find a way to use your time more efficiently? Or could you even just make the changes necessary to devote more of your energy to tasks you enjoy? What would happen if you changed the way you spent your day so completely—would it enable you to really follow your dreams? 

Disrupting your internal value chain is the same as breaking down a car engine in order to rebuild it into a race car. You can’t win a race without a winning mind-set. You have everything you need to thrive; you just have to plan for the race of your life. Each person’s journey and process is unique. The key to adopting a disruptor’s mind-set is to honestly assess your internal value chain to overcome every obstacle in the way. Annihilate all the assumptions that put

limitations on your dreams and your expectations for yourself. Question what you’ve always been told are your strengths and weaknesses. Train yourself to think differently. Market your potential. Distribute your energy wisely and efficiently. As four-time Academy Award–winning actress Katharine Hepburn famously stated, “We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers—but never blame yourself. It’s never your fault. But it’s always your fault, because if you wanted to change, you’re the one who has got to change.” 

You can’t win a race without a winning mind-set. You have everything you need to thrive; you just have to plan for the race of your life.

Chapter Three 

The Disruptor’s Map 

Map out your future—but do it in pencil. 

The road ahead is as long as you make it. 

Make it worth the trip. 

—Jon Bon Jovi 

The previous chapter demonstrated how you can analyze your internal value chain to adopt the mind-set of a disruptor. By pinpointing weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the various links that form our identities, we empower ourselves to make the changes necessary to thrive. We have determined that success in the era of disruption comes from finding and exploiting opportunities created by the entrant of a new technology or product. But today’s most successful disruptors didn’t just sit around waiting for opportunity to knock. No, they went out and created it. All of the innovators I know created opportunity for themselves by seeing their lives and their paths to success as journeys. I’m not saying they had everything planned out, but almost everyone I interviewed for this book had a starting point and an end goal in mind. They didn’t wait to understand what all of the steps along the way would look like, but they did try to draw some sort of map for themselves before they embarked. I have often said that if I knew everything I know about business today back when I started my first company at twenty-one, I would never have started it. Accepting that the odds are against you is the same as accepting defeat before you begin. Once you’ve decided to pursue your dreams, you’ll need some guiding directions.

Whether you want to think of it as creating a disruptor’s map, writing a mission statement, or putting together a personal business plan, I encourage you to create a document by responding—in writing—to the prompts detailed in this chapter. 

Accepting that the odds are against you is the same as accepting defeat before you begin. 

TURN YOUR ASPIRATIONS INTO INSPIRATIONS 

Remember how easy it was as a child to daydream about your future? You could easily see yourself as an astronaut, rock star, or firefighter. Perhaps you saw a movie or read a novel that instantly transformed your dreams. What boy didn’t want to run off and enlist in the air force after watching Top Gun? What girl watching Broadcast News hasn’t dreamed of being a powerful network news producer in Washington, D.C.? 

In 1987, a struggling, unknown twenty-five-year-old comedian named Jim Carrey looked up at the Hollywood sign and wrote himself a check for $10 million. A dream turns into a plan the moment you assign a deadline to it. Carrey filled in the date on the check as Thanksgiving 1995. He began his disruptor’s journey by giving himself a specific timeline to accomplish his goals. Once you have a date, you can work backward in your mind, listing the steps needed to achieve your goal. Amazingly, Carrey made his goal happen a year ahead of schedule. In 1994, for his starring role as Lloyd Christmas in Dumb and Dumber, Carrey was paid $10 million. 

While we can’t all be movie stars, we can visualize our futures. What do you really want to accomplish? What steps will it take to complete your journey? Over a hundred years ago, an Illinois farmer named Wallace Wattles wrote a bestselling book about visualization titled The Science of Getting Rich. 

“Live in the new house; wear the fine clothes; ride in the automobile; go on the journey, and confidently plan for greater journeys,” Wattles wrote. “Think and speak of all the things you have asked for in terms of actual present ownership. Imagine an environment, and a financial condition exactly as you

want them, and live all the time in that imaginary environment and financial condition.”1 

Wattles’s point is that you can’t achieve dreams you don’t have. You wouldn’t invest in a company that didn’t have a business plan, would you? Where is the company going? What are its goals? Does it have the resources it needs to succeed? Why not demand the same things of yourself? You can always change businesses, but you have only one life. If you don’t know where you want to be in five years, how do you expect to get there? As life coach Tony Gaskins so wisely says, “If you don’t build your dream, someone will hire you to help build theirs.” 

If you don’t know where you want to be in five years, how do you expect to get there? 

I grew up in a row house in Philadelphia, where I had little exposure to and thus no concept of what wealth was or how rich people lived. Then one day I became fixated on a man with pet polar bears. 

My father was a public school math teacher living a pretty standard urban life until the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957. This act of Communist superiority spurred the United States government to create the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). With the fate of the free world at stake, DARPA had nearly unlimited funds and access to America’s best research universities, with one mission: to restore America’s technological lead. It was because of DARPA that computers first became networked, creating a hypertext system that eventually became the Internet. 

But back in 1957, America, at the height of the Cold War, when millions of homeowners were building fallout shelters in case of nuclear attacks and schoolchildren were being trained to get under their desks to “duck and cover,” Sputnik galvanized the American public into action. 

Washington realized that a lot more engineers were needed to beat the red menace. With a wave of hysteria from an anxious public, the federal government began funneling nearly limitless amounts of money into mathematics, science, and engineering education programs. All good and patriotic American high school math teachers were called upon to go back to college to get advanced

degrees. My twenty-nine-year-old father realized: if the government was going to pay for him to go back to school during his summer break from teaching, why not go to the farthest place they would send him and turn these summers of higher learning into family vacations? So began my favorite part of my childhood: our cross-country road trips and the man with the polar bears. 

As my father worked on his master’s degree at Arizona State University, my sister and I lived in the dorms on campus. It was there, as a young boy, that I had my first interaction with computers. At the end of the summer, before we had to return to our real lives in Philadelphia, my dad would take us to see the sights all across America and fill my head with a world greater than my imagination. I loved Disneyland, SeaWorld, and the national parks, but the place that profoundly changed my view of the world was Hearst Castle. 

For those who haven’t been to La Cuesta Encantada (the Enchanted Hill), as newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst named it, Hearst Castle is an over the-top, opulent, sixty-thousand-square-foot house set atop 250,000 acres of rolling hills—including fourteen miles of private coastline—in San Simeon, California. Built over twenty-eight years, the castle has fifty-six bedrooms, sixty-one bathrooms, nineteen sitting rooms, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, tennis courts, a movie theater, an airfield, and the world’s largest private zoo. 

As a small child, I couldn’t appreciate the antiquities Hearst had assembled from all over the world. Solid gold faucets and twenty-foot-long dining tables didn’t register with me, either. But on a sweltering California summer day, when our tour guide explained that, in addition to the cattle and zebras roaming around the property, Hearst had men truck ice up the mountain every day to keep the polar bears cool, I was mesmerized. That was wealth. That was the thing dreams were made of. 

So when my parents told me that if I got all As in school I could someday build my own castle like Hearst’s, I believed them. I remember spending the next year drawing out the floor plan of my castle on graph paper and magically getting straight As on all my report cards. I wanted to be successful and began visualizing my future. I didn’t need to know how I was going to get there, but I knew what I wanted to achieve. My dreams may have changed as I matured, but I still have a picture of Hearst Castle on my office wall.

Bestselling author and motivational speaker Norman Vincent Peale has written volumes on the importance of attitude. “Formulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental picture of yourself as succeeding. Hold this picture tenaciously. Never permit it to fade. Your mind will seek to develop the picture … Do not build up obstacles in your imagination.”2 

Before you head off on your commute each morning, find a quiet place and retreat to it. Put away the phone and close out the present world. Fifteen minutes each morning will change the outcome of your entire day. Close your eyes and imagine the world you want. What do you aspire to do? Visualize living that life. Visualize every detail and engage all your senses. Hear the waves crashing outside the beach house you want to own. Smell the salty sea air. The more you focus on being in the world you want to create for yourself, the more powerful the results. As Antti Revonsuo discovered by studying subjects while in the dream state of sleep, your subconscious cannot emotionally distinguish between what is real and what you feel is real. Starting each day with a positive mind-set is the most important step in your journey to discovering opportunity.

Financial guru and talk show host Suze Orman didn’t start off life rich. After failing in the restaurant business, and with no formal finance training, Orman started working on Wall Street. In her books, she has recounted how she felt intimidated and unworthy, but she visualized a better life for herself. Orman’s most famous self-perception-changing affirmation is “I will have more money than I will ever need.”3 

As you spend more time consistently visualizing your future, a pattern will develop. You will begin to focus on those things most important to you. Let these aspirations inspire you, and write them down. What are you passionate about? What is missing from your life? Start writing down your dreams and begin turning them into goals. That is the essence of a personal road map or life path. 

ASK YOURSELF, WHERE DO I WANT TO GO ALONG THE

WAY? 

You’ve thought about what you’re aspiring to; now think about what else you want to find along the way. Do you want a family? Are you willing to delay one part of your life to pursue another aspect with more focus? “The purpose of life is a life of purpose,” author and billiards guru Robert Byrne wrote.4 What matters most to you? How you embody and achieve these core values will determine how you measure your success. Try writing these values down on a piece of paper. Be as detailed as you can. Include your personal and professional goals. 

Next, list your priorities in terms of relationships and time commitments. How much personal, spiritual, and family time do you require? All work and no play is unsustainable as a life plan. You can truly have it all, just not all at the same time. The more realistic you are about how you are going to prioritize your goals in life, the more in charge of your future you will be. For women, balancing goals against a ticking biological clock makes this step all the more important. Try to be honest and complete—the more detail you put into your plan, the more resources you will have to achieve it. 

You can truly have it all, just not all at the same time. 

Being an active and involved father was as important to me as building my business. I found the balance I needed in my life by running my company out of my home until my boys were old enough to go to school. We made a game out of the boys being super-quiet whenever I got a business call. Once they were old enough, I would involve them in my software publishing projects so that they understood what Daddy did all day. As it turned out, at nine years old my eldest had a real talent for proofreading packaging and enjoyed finding mistakes that all of us “grown-ups” missed. I knew what I wanted out of life and set my priorities accordingly. 

While on maternity leave in 2010, first-time mother Kristy Lewis came up with the idea of creating a healthier microwave popcorn. Balancing motherhood and launching a business, she started Quinn Popcorn (named after her newborn son), which is now available at over a thousand retail locations. “The first year was really challenging. I was working 24 hours a day. But if you have a mission,

you make it work,” Lewis said.5 

Comedian David Brenner was at the top of his career when divorce threw him into a bitter custody battle for his son Cole. Though Brenner was the most frequent guest on The Tonight Show in the 1970s and ’80s, a judge declared that he would be considered an absentee father if he was away from home for more than fifty nights a year. Brenner’s dream to be a great father was more important than being America’s top comic, so he stopped appearing on Johnny Carson’s show in order to keep custody of his son. We all have choices to make with our lives and our careers. The disruptor’s map helps you focus on taking control of those choices. 

Achieving work-life balance is about defining your goals and expressing them on your disruptor’s map. What are the things outside your career you wish to achieve or experience? Plan for space and time on your map to pursue your passions. How much time do you need to set aside for family and friends? We all get so caught up in our own lives that we miss out on the lives of those dearest to us. Plan for ways to get more enjoyment into your life and you will get more joy out of it.

PACK YOUR DISRUPTOR’S SUITCASE 

Whether you are going away for a vacation or an important business trip, you pack a bag filled with the things you will need. You can’t enjoy Hawaii without a bathing suit, and it is pretty hard to give a PowerPoint presentation without your laptop. A career is just a longer trip with a whole lot more baggage. Set off unprepared and you shouldn’t be surprised when you don’t achieve your goals. Today you need to recognize which things might be essential for you to arrive at your ultimate destination. You must bring urgency to packing your disruptor’s suitcase. 

A career is just a longer trip with a whole lot more baggage. As you’ve been thinking about what you aspire to and considering your other

priorities, you haven’t had to take into account the resources you’ll need to achieve those results. As with a business plan that assumes the need for additional team members and skill sets to build a company, your disruptor’s journey will require external help. What training, mentors, and capital will you need? As you would do with any competing product, research other individuals in your industry and find out how they got the resources they needed to succeed. In most cases, you will discover a world full of people waiting to help you achieve your goals. 

Even the work you do and where you do it can be a resource. When accepting a job, always ask yourself two questions: Will this position move me closer to achieving my goal? How long will I stay at this job before moving on? The answer to the second question should be determined by how much you can learn and grow at that particular job. A job at a small startup, for example, may give you the opportunity to try your hand at a wider range of tasks than you could in a more regimented position at a larger company. By testing and pushing your limits at the startup, you may discover personal strengths and skills that you didn’t know you possessed. On the other hand, overreaching will highlight areas where you need additional training and experience to succeed. Choose wisely and with purpose. 

When a job no longer offers you the opportunity for personal growth, then it is time to move on. Remember that there is a big difference between giving up and knowing when you have had enough. If your daily routine is monotonous, and weeks roll into years, you will find your dreams slipping away. If you can’t afford the risk of quitting, try transferring internally within your company or look for another position in your field. If you work in a larger corporation, speak with someone in human resources about the type of skills you would like to develop, and you may just find out that the company is willing to pay for you to take courses or earn an additional degree in exchange for staying with the company. I can assure you that when you reach the midpoint of your working years, you will have more regrets about the things you didn’t try than the ones you tried and didn’t succeed at. 

You will have more regrets about the things you didn’t try than the ones you tried and didn’t succeed at.

I have spent my life going into new industries and fields with little understanding of their inner workings and not knowing any of their key influencers. In each case, my success was not achieved alone. When I was recruited by EMI president and CEO Ken Berry to bring the hundred-year-old British record company into the digital age, I knew nothing about running a music label. I remember exactly what Ken said to me on my first day: “I have eleven thousand people who know the music business. What I don’t have is a future.” Over the next few years, every time I hit a brick wall or had an idea that might or might not work, Ken made the time to mentor me. Together we transformed the company and the music industry by pioneering new business models in digital downloads, music subscriptions, and streaming Internet radio. I didn’t travel the road alone, and I can assure you that you won’t, either. 

Mentors are invaluable—and often crucial—to a disruptor’s success. Mentors are also surprisingly easy to find. By reading blogs for your industry, you will quickly discover the luminaries you aspire to emulate. Send them an email. Reach out and ask for advice. Don’t write, “Will you be my mentor?” Rather, try something like “I was thinking about starting a company that does X and wanted to know your thoughts.” Value people’s time when they give it, and thank them when it proves helpful. Even in the twenty-first century, nothing is as powerful or personal as sending a handwritten thank-you note. (The most significant person in my life, my wife, I met through a simple thank-you note.) With persistence and a little luck, you will find a mentor who can guide you through your career and could help accelerate its pace. 

“The fastest way to change yourself is to hang out with people who are already the way you want to be,” billionaire Reid Hoffman suggests.6 Role models are a key factor in developing a successful persona. Success can actually rub off on you. How do you meet role models? You can start by going to more conferences and gatherings in your field. Get to know the industry leaders. Use LinkedIn and other online tools to reach out to people you admire. Finding the right mentor can provide you with both personal validation and professional growth. 

I have a friend who wrote a cold-call letter to one of America’s most famous business leaders. She explained that, having won some money on the game show Jeopardy, she could afford to work for him as his assistant for one dollar. He

must have been impressed by her no-nonsense approach, because he hired her and launched her career as one of the most connected people in the business world. Twenty years later, she sits on many boards and advises the next generation of billionaires. For those without the resources to work for free, paying internships can open the door to endless opportunities. Oprah Winfrey learned the ropes as an intern at the CBS affiliate in Nashville, and designer Tom Ford got his start interning for Chloé. George Hu started as an intern at Salesforce.com and now is the chief operating officer of the $33 billion public company. 

The adage that the master appears when the student is ready to learn is true only if you make the effort to seek out advice. Every successful person would love to share his or her knowledge with the next generation. It validates the mentor’s accomplishments and gives them a sense of continuing value. Today I mentor college students and first-time entrepreneurs as a way of paying forward all the countless times others have aided me. I enjoy joining their boards, helping them raise capital, and even beta-testing their apps. 

The adage that the master appears when the student is ready to learn is true only if you make the effort to seek out advice. 

ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE You are not going to live forever. Hospice workers say that the number-one regret they hear from dying patients is that they wish they had been courageous enough to live true to themselves and had not been guided by the expectations of others.7 Life is short—so what is stopping you? To really achieve everything you set out to accomplish, you must set deadlines. Work backward from each deadline and develop incremental steps. What are the pieces that make up the whole goal? Bill Murray’s character in the movie What About Bob? says it brilliantly when he repeats to himself the need to take “baby steps.” 

Achieving goals is also about delaying the instant gratification that comes so easily in our always-on lifestyle. Delaying marriage, children, or vacations to build a career or a company is about living a few years of your life in a way most people won’t so that you can spend the rest of your life living at a level most people can’t. The easiest way to set priorities is by working backward from a

future goal. I am often asked by young entrepreneurs if now is a good time to start a business. My answer is always the same: “A year ago was the best time to start your business. The second-best time is now.” 

Live a few years of your life in a way most people won’t so that you can spend the rest of your life living at a level most people can’t. 

Proving that you are never too old to disrupt is my business partner Doug Netter. At ninety-two, Netter (along with Steven Latham and I) sold the first multiscreen interactive game show to a major television network, in 2012. Doug has been working in Hollywood longer than most executives have been on this planet, but ever since I worked with him to pioneer new technology on Babylon 5 in the 1990s, he has always strived to innovate television. With this game show we wanted to finally change the way people interacted with traditional television. The tagline for Bet You Know is “Instead of watching from home, you can be winning from home.” Though the show never made it past the pilot stage, Doug remains a constant inspiration, demonstrating that you really can change any industry if you just keep moving forward and that never is the right time to quit. 

Every successful disruptor I know refused to sit back and wait. They didn’t worry about the time being right or the conditions being perfect; they just dived right in. Do you want to be left standing on the shore?

“Failing to plan is planning to fail,” bestselling time management author Alan Lakein cleverly wrote.8 The author of How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life adds, “Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now.”9If you’ve been responding to these prompts, you now have your disruptor’s map. 

Committing your aspirations, priorities, resources, and deadlines to paper gives you a personal business plan to measure your progress against. The difference between successful and unsuccessful people is that successful ones know that the most unprofitable thing ever manufactured is an excuse.

Chapter Four 

Building a Brand of One 

Who am I, anyway? Am I my résumé? 

—“I Hope I Get It,” A Chorus Line 

When I read online that HealthAddress had just been acquired, I knew that meant my friend Kelly Lefkowitz would once again be out of work. We’ve all been there. You just lost your job and are fearful that the phone will never ring again. You wonder if you’ll ever find a job worthy of your talents or even one in your field. When we’re in that situation, we like to blame the economy, the competition, or that unappreciative moronic supervisor, but in the end it always comes back to blaming ourselves. It doesn’t matter the cause; getting sacked feels like a kick in the gut. Whether you are downsized because of a merger or your company closes its doors, there is nothing more disruptive to your life than becoming unemployed. Being out of work and looking for a new job happens to my friend Kelly more often than it does to other people. Kelly’s reward as a brilliant chief financial officer for building a financially sound company is being let go when the firm is sold to a major corporation. Kelly has the unfortunate habit of firing himself. 

When he and I met for lunch to brainstorm what he would do next, Kelly had been in finance for more than twenty years. Many middle-aged workers fear that all those years of experience are now used against them when looking for a new job. Are they too old or too expensive? I encouraged Kelly to take this opportunity to disrupt himself. We deconstructed his training and experience, his strengths and expertise. We explored the ways he presents himself and how he

spends his time. Kelly has worked with dozens of startups and written over a hundred business plans. He had guided inexperienced CEOs through the whole process of fund-raising. He isn’t just a finance guy; he is one of the most experienced strategic-planning experts in the startup space. By thinking of his professional self as the total value of each interlocking link in the chain, Kelly saw how he could transition into his next professional position. He realized that the link in his personal value chain that was ripest for disruption was distribution: every company seeking capital could use his unique talents, but very few could afford him full-time. Why not create a business that would provide his services and those of interim CFOs to fast-growing young companies for only the brief amount of time they most need the financial help? Kelly created the company Strat/Assist and has never looked back. 

This chapter will explore the ways disruptors think about their professional selves and how they approach the business world, pinpointing opportunities for disruption to help build their careers. It will also describe how recent disruptions in our business landscape have transformed the way people can promote themselves and their companies. 

To succeed in business, one must see oneself as a brand: a brand of one. The links in your personal value chain constitute your unique brand. The research and development links are defined by your education, your previous work experience, and the sources you pursue to find a job in the first place. The work you do—its quality and content—makes up the design and production links. The way you present yourself professionally constitutes the marketing and sales links in your personal value chain. And where you work, with whom you work, and where you devote your professional energies determine your distribution link. Think about your professional value as the combination of these links in the chain. If you are struggling to get a job, or if you are ready to make a career transition, all you need to do is target the link ripest for disruption. 

DISRUPT THE RECRUITMENT VALUE CHAIN 

For most people, finding the perfect job seems like a fantasy. It can seem as if

we never hear about dream jobs until they are filled or that potential employers don’t even know we exist. Sites like LinkedIn and Monster.com can’t always solve this mismatch of supply and demand. If anything, the sheer volume of job boards and online résumés has made most applicants feel like tiny needles in the largest of haystacks. But in today’s volatile business world, carving out the right career path is essential to attaining your goals—especially if you’re looking to start your own business. 

The truth is, by thinking of where you look to try to get a job as being a link in the value chain, you can see clearly how value is created and how disrupting that process becomes a straightforward and manageable task. A generation ago, when I first graduated from UCLA, the U.S. economy was in shambles, and virtually no recruiters came to campus. I knew I wanted a job in the entertainment industry, but I didn’t have any connections, and I never heard about who was hiring until after the position had been filled. Oftentimes, the best opportunities were filled without ever having been advertised. Looking at this situation from a value chain perspective, I realized that the real value to be captured would be in finding out who would be hiring before any job descriptions were posted. Instinctively I knew I needed to create a competitive advantage. I figured that if I had first crack at job openings, I had the best chance of getting hired. But how could I find out before my competitors who would be willing to hire someone with my qualifications? 

The answer was simple: take out a help-wanted ad in the Hollywood Reporter describing a fantasy position that matched my qualifications. This out of-the-box approach yielded three key pieces of data. First, the résumés that people submitted in response to my ad showed me the competitive landscape of employable talent. Before the Internet, getting any kind of data like this was a real challenge. This helped me answer questions like: How do I rewrite and reimagine my résumé to be more competitive and stand out? Do I have skills that I hadn’t displayed in the proper manner that others had highlighted on their résumés? With this reconnaissance I was able to craft the perfect entry-level résumé. 

Second, the majority of people applying for my “dream job” were currently employed somewhere else. These people were not just employed anywhere; they were in jobs that they believed would be the perfect stepping stone to getting my

dream job. Logic dictated that if I worked at those places, I would be that much closer to achieving my dream job, too. 

Finally, running that ad identified which employers had employees with one foot out the door. Whatever their reasons, the people who responded to my ad wanted to leave their present positions and work somewhere else. Now I had a list of companies that would most likely be experiencing turnover and potentially hiring someone at my level in the near future. All I had to do was make sure that my new, improved résumé was in their human resources directors’ hands immediately—before those current employees had even left. One of the very first places that received my revised résumé called me immediately for an interview, and my career was launched. 

Today, most jobs are not listed in the newspaper, and online job postings don’t always tell you the name of the employer. So how does my thirty-year-old example work in the digital age? The same value chain for human capital still exists, and it is just as easily disrupted. 

In 2010, Alec Brownstein was just another copywriter working at the bottom of a large New York advertising agency. It’s not that Alec hated his job, but he dreamed of working at a really creative shop with the most innovative creative directors on Madison Avenue. He knew who these creative executives were, but not how to meet them or get on their radar. While googling around to see the latest work by these industry luminaries, Brownstein noticed that no sponsored links were attached to the searches for their names. Sponsored links are the ads that appear on the top of every search results page. Brownstein saw an opportunity. 

“Everyone googles themselves,” Brownstein explains, “even if they don’t admit it. I wanted to invade that secret, egotistical moment when [they] were most vulnerable.” 

As the only bidder for the names of top creative directors, Brownstein could secure the top search placements for fifteen cents per click. Whenever a creative director’s name was searched, the following appeared next to the results: “Hey, [creative director’s name]: Goooogling [sic] yourself is a lot of fun. Hiring me is fun, too,” with a link to Brownstein’s website. His ingeniously simple plan worked. 

Eighty percent of the creative directors took the bait and called Alec.

Brownstein received job offers from two superstar creative directors, Scott Vitrone and Ian Reichenthal. Total cost for disrupting one of the world’s most creative industries: $6. The effect on Brownstein’s career: priceless. That wasn’t the only bonus from his investment. In a field that rewards creativity, Alec Brownstein also won a Clio—the advertising industry’s most prestigious award —in the self-promotion category. 

“Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there in an interesting way,” Brownstein advises. “The people who you want to work for can’t hire you any less than they already are. So shoot for the moon.”1 

The most creative approach a prospective hire ever took to get my attention happened when I was president of a division at Universal Studios. The applicant rightly assumed that everyone, even senior executives, likes presents. One day I received a large box in the mail. Inside were the two oddest items I could imagine: a metal spaghetti colander and a bag of candied dates. Intrigued, I read the note: “My apologies for the mix-up. I asked my assistant to get me dates on your calendar and she misunderstood. Can we meet next week?” I figured anyone who could get me to laugh was worth meeting. You can’t get the dream job in your field unless you get noticed. Differentiation in the job market is just another variant on my axiom “Be the best at what you do or the only one doing it.” 

“Be the best at what you do or the only one doing it.” 

RELAUNCHING YOUR BRAND 

But what happens when you get the dream job, you create a great career, and your entire industry gets disrupted? Worse, if you see yourself as having achieved only a narrow band of experience at one company, or in one industry, and that field goes away, is your career therefore over? Case in point: the music industry at the turn of the twenty-first century. 

As I will later recall in detail, in 1999, when nineteen-year-old Shawn Fanning walked into my office at Capitol Records, I knew the world of the record label would never be the same and that the music labels were the canaries

in the mineshaft of digital intellectual property. Thanks to their technology, Napster, which Fanning developed with Sean Parker, millions of consumers could steal any song they wanted and play it on any device. Overnight, the music industry’s value chain was shattered. Developing songs, discovering and nurturing new talent, designing marketing campaigns, producing music videos, getting airplay on radio or on MTV, making sure new releases got proper placement on retailers’ shelves—none of this mattered if no one was buying the albums. U.S. music sales plummeted, from $14.6 billion in 1999 to $6.3 billion in 2009.2 Perhaps the former head of Yahoo Music, Dave Goldberg, said it best: “The digital music business has been a war of attrition.”3 

The implosion of the music industry meant that tens of thousands of record label employees lost their jobs. When I was global president of digital at EMI, we had to consolidate and close labels, cut our artist roster, and let go of employees all over the world. The company that had grown out of Emile Berliner’s first marketing of disc records in 1889, the world’s largest independent music company, which had signed Queen and Pink Floyd, would be cut up and sold for its catalog within a decade. 

People who had crafted very specific skills in the music business were forced to enter a new job market that wasn’t looking for record executives. For these people, career disruption forced self-disruption. Take record label marketing executives as an example. Some of the greatest marketers in the world worked at record labels. Unlike the marketers for Coke or Jim Beam, who get to build off of brand-name recognition that has developed over many decades and millions of dollars in advertising spent, a record label isn’t marketing “Capitol Records” or “Blue Note.” Instead, marketers at labels have to take an unknown bunch of kids making music in a garage and turn them into a household name around the globe. These creative thinkers have to achieve this miracle over and over again, with limited budgets and with a “product” that can talk back to you and say no if the artist doesn’t like the marketing campaign. 

This constant introduction of new acts by the labels meant that these marketing teams had mastered a number of highly desirable skill sets that had absolutely nothing to do with music. Everything from creating a band’s image (branding) to generating buzz (earned media) to getting on the shelves (point-of sale merchandising) are experiences and skills applicable to every product sold

in the world. With so many music marketers losing their careers, this expertise was now available to other product categories that needed marketing innovation. For example, in 2011, the global market for mobile phone accessories was estimated at $34 billion.4 Most items either were sold alongside mobile phones or could be used by other devices and therefore just migrated into the category from portable audio. Earbuds and headphones were, for the most part, undifferentiated accessories. If better branding could be brought to this category of six billion consumers, the potential for profits could be massive. What if all the tools and creative marketing used for hit bands were applied to headphones? It stands to reason that this approach should be successful, since the end consumer is the same music aficionado. Beats by Dr. Dre, the brainchild of Dre and Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine, did just that. They hired ex– music label executives to build branding and buzz for the headphones by associating with artists and athletes. Celebrity endorsement on this scale causes pull-through at retail. Consumers go into retail stores and ask for the Beats product by name, which in turn has retailers clamoring for the products. The startup enjoyed massive distribution at retail and sold over $350 million worth of headphones in 2011.5 The following year, the brand used typical music-label style guerilla marketing to hijack attention at the London Olympic Games (where official sponsors spent upward of $100 million plus media to participate) without spending a dime. Beats’ marketing department sidestepped all the International Olympic Committee’s rules by sending the Olympic athletes free headphones. When the global television audience tuned in to see swimmer Michael Phelps (and virtually every other swimmer) sporting Beats headphones before jumping into the water at the Aquatics Centre, it was the brilliant work of ex–music label execs that was on display. Billions of “stolen” TV impressions were purloined by people who had rebooted their careers. For the music label execs who had been put out of work, all it took was a little self-disruption. They disrupted the production links in their internal value chains, thinking critically about their skills and past experiences and applying them to something other than a band or a record label. When people ask me for advice when they’re looking to make a career transition, I always tell them to think about what they did in their job, not just what company or product they did it for. In addition to thinking about your true skill set, it’s critical to continually

refresh the research and development link in your internal value chain. In the twenty-first century, lifelong learning is no longer a luxury but a necessity for employment. Would you go to a fifty-year-old doctor who hadn’t learned anything new since he graduated from medical school in 1988? Of the hundred most prescribed medications in the United States, everything from Nexium to Tamiflu, all one hundred would have been invented since your doctor finished her residency.6 

Lifelong learning is no longer a luxury but a necessity for employment. 

“We’re beginning to recognize that it may not make sense to work at just one job for your entire life, retire for a few years, and then die. Instead, we’re more likely to take a cyclic approach to life education, work, and leisure and mix these up throughout our lifetimes. People are going back to school at 45, 65, even 80,” Maddy Dychtwald writes in her book Cycles: How We Will Live, Work, and Buy. “People are having second, third, fourth, even fifth careers.”7 

DIFFERENTIATE YOUR BRAND 

Why would an employer hire you if your skills are out of date? And if you’re starting your own business, is your knowledge up to date with today’s market conditions? Distance learning and online courses have made staying current easier than ever. Most classes can be taken at any time that fits your personal schedule. Many software manufacturers offer courses online at little or no cost that include completion certificates you can reference on your CV. Anyone can claim Photoshop experience on their résumé, but don’t you think prospective employers would rather hire someone who is Adobe-certified? 

It is also important to think about how your professional education is reflected in the marketing link of your personal value chain. Many certification programs allow those who complete the training to leverage the power of the brand’s logos on their business cards or websites. One of my earliest business cards proudly displayed the “IBM Business Partner” logo as a differentiator. An added benefit of taking these courses is that corporate recruiters looking for new talent to hire often scan professional registries of program graduates.

Learning new skills contributes value to the research and development link of your personal value chain, but how you communicate those skills constitutes your marketing and sales link. Getting noticed and differentiating yourself from your colleagues is half the battle. Crafting the right language to describe your accomplishments is also crucial. Most applications are scanned by recruiters for only a matter of seconds. With your entire career at stake, every word needs to be carefully chosen to “sell” your unique story. 

The most important tool you have on a résumé is language. Action verbs convey energy and excitement about your accomplishments and communicate your drive. They bring to life past activities and make every experience sound specific and useful. The following list of terms was originally created in the heart of Silicon Valley by NOVA, an employment and training agency that provides educational programing to address the workforce needs of companies in the area.8 Try rewriting your résumé and incorporating these terms to communicate your work experience and expertise. Think of how your résumé communicates who you are, what you can do, and how those skills make you valuable and unique.

I was not always aware of the importance of personal branding. In fact, I spent a good part of my career believing that my work should speak for itself. It doesn’t. How we market and sell ourselves comes into play long before we get the opportunity to prove ourselves through our work. My shortcomings in personal branding were pointed out to me in my very first week at EMI, by Virgin Music Group’s vice chairwoman, Nancy Berry. 

I was raised to believe that in business, men wore suits and ties to important meetings. When I started at EMI, my first time in the C-suite, I was about to fly around the world to meet all of the label heads across the United States, Europe, and Asia, and of course I planned to wear my best suits and ties. I was an international executive, and I wanted to look the part. I had been hired to transform the music industry, and I took the responsibility very seriously. But what I failed to grasp was that this was the world’s largest music company, not a bank—everyone around me was wearing T-shirts and jeans. Lucky for me, my first meeting was in Los Angeles with the head of Virgin Records. 

I sat in Nancy’s Beverly Hills office, the scent of candles wafting in the air, wearing a pinstriped suit and power tie, trying to explain my vision for the future of the music industry to a barefoot vice chairwoman. She graciously listened. But I could tell that my message wasn’t registering. Then Nancy asked me a very poignant question that caught me off guard: How was I going to get musicians, their managers, and label executives to follow my lead into this new digital age if no one could relate to me? I looked like a corporate lawyer, not a record guy with a passion for the future of music. I was coming into their world and looked as out of place as an Amish farmer at a Jay-Z concert. Just as she had done with many a developing music act over the years, Nancy did what she does best: she helped me create my brand. She helped me craft a new image before I embarked on my world tour of the company’s thirty labels. 

I grew a goatee, traded in the suits for an all-black wardrobe, and developed a look that was consistent with the message I was marketing: music evolved. As superficial as it may sound, the clothes do make the man. The first impression I made was critical because I was going to be asking everyone I met all around the world to change how they were running their business. They needed to believe that I understood their world before they would be willing to learn about the new

digital world I was pitching. Thanks to Nancy, the message now matched the packaging, and I was able to get everyone on board to achieve the goals I had set for the company. 

Sometimes rebranding is as simple as rethinking how you distribute your professional energies. Eileen Gittins, a Silicon Valley CEO, was in her forties and burned out after the dot-com crash of 2000. Looking for more balance and joy, she threw her energy into the hobby of photography. Gittins spent a year photographing people she had worked with and hand-developing each print. Thinking of her brand as more of an artist than a tech executive, Gittins went looking for a site where she could upload her images and print a quality book. Finding none, she combined her passion, her new brand, and her past to create Blurb. Today Blurb ships over two million books a year and has shipped them to seventy-five countries.9 

The most profound rebranding I have ever witnessed was that of a convicted felon with cancer whose doctors had given him eighteen months to live. In the 1980s, Michael Milken was the most powerful man on Wall Street. A smart, driven trader whom Drexel Burnham once paid $550 million, Milken changed American corporate finance and was the embodiment of Gordon Gekko’s “Greed is good.” But his excess and success came to a screeching halt in 1989 when the government filed a ninety-eight-count indictment against him. After he served his time in prison, few people ever expected a second act for Milken. 

Days after getting out, in 1993, Milken was diagnosed with prostate cancer and informed that he had less than two years to live. He changed his priorities and his brand. Not knowing how much time he had left, Milken put all his energies into helping others. He worked with charities and established the Prostate Cancer Foundation. He helped educational companies get funding and founded the Milken Institute, a think tank that’s dedicated to “Changing the World in Innovative Ways.” Milken’s annual Global Conference attracts global business leaders, heads of state, and NGO directors, all working together to solve the problems facing our world. Michael Milken’s rebranding is complete, and his impact has been far greater than anyone could ever have imagined it would be when he was at the height of his Wall Street junk bond trading days, decades ago. 

Today, having disrupted myself and changed jobs several times since those

early days at EMI, I am back at work in the corporate world of suits. Disrupting your style and brand is about evolving. In the end, failure comes when you stop. Or, as 50 Cent so aptly put it, “get rich or die tryin’.” 

PERSONAL PROMOTION 

Personal branding is especially challenging. You may work at many jobs in your life, but you have only one career. Even if you change directions, as Gittins and Milken did, you need to believe in the core values that make you believe in yourself. If the race against diminishing capital defines the startup company, the race against time defines the brand of one. Instead of reliving past mistakes and beating yourself up for what you could or should have done in the past, look at ways to pivot in the future. Look at your career as a constant race against a ticking clock. 

If the race against diminishing capital defines the startup company, the race against time defines the brand of one. 

One of the best ways to leverage and promote your brand of one is through public speaking. I realize that to many, getting up in front of a roomful of strangers may be a bit intimidating, but public speaking is undoubtedly the most effective way to cold-call hundreds of people at the same time. 

Every industry has conferences in need of speakers. You don’t have to be famous; you just have to be persistent. Send emails out to event planners, outlining in a paragraph what you plan on presenting and why it will be of value to that particular audience. Ninety percent of the time they are happy to find someone to fill a time slot. If you’re nervous in front of a large crowd, ask to speak before a local business breakfast meeting or ask to guest-lecture a class at a local university in order to gain confidence. Many national organizations coordinate regional conferences so that you can travel the country giving the same talk at several gatherings of the same group. 

The more unique your topic, the less competition you will have. One of the first major speeches I gave, when I was in my twenties, was to the National Association of Chiefs of Police convention. I know nothing about law

enforcement, but I did know what impact the Internet was going to have on cyber crime. I was the first computer geek they had ever booked, and the speech resulted in consulting work. What are you uniquely qualified to discuss? How can you be the change of pace the event planner is looking for? The more original the topic, the more in demand you will be. One of the most interesting and unique speakers I have ever heard, Michio Kaku, is a theoretical physicist who makes the most incomprehensible science relevant and engaging. 

I was speaking in Mumbai last year to a crowd of nearly a thousand Indian media executives. In a country of over one billion people, I didn’t know a single person. After that thirty-minute speech, I was inundated by people handing me their cards, scheduling meetings, and emailing me with requests to work together. Within a month’s time I had a network of contacts across the subcontinent and was doing business with one of India’s largest tech companies. From Seoul to Rome, Toronto to Moscow, I have walked into darkened rooms filled with strangers and walked out with business associates and lifelong friends. 

As we were building ooVoo into the number-one app in the world for teens, I needed to find a way to get the key decision makers at top youth brands to advertise with us. Most major brands work through advertising agencies, so getting to the actual brand’s chief marketing officer is a formidable task. The conference I needed to speak at was the PTTOW! (Plan to Take on the World) youth marketing conference, run by Roman Tsunder. I had attended in the past and knew the room would be filled with dozens of potential clients. At many larger conferences, speaking slots are reserved for paid sponsors. So when all else fails, if the audience is paramount to your company’s success, don’t be afraid to pay to play. As soon as I finished my talk, Target’s CMO, Jeff Jones, walked up to me and said that he really wanted to speak with me. His fourteen year-old daughter was a big user of ooVoo and had told him I was “the guy to meet” at the conference. Target spends over $1 billion a year on advertising.10It doesn’t get any better than that. 

As powerful as public speaking is as a tool for marketing you or your company, I know it is not for everyone. If you are the kind of person who, if given the choice at a funeral, would rather be in the casket than deliver the eulogy, then there is a way to communicate with millions without uttering a
