Hey team, here's our updated game plan for FitAI. Let's dive in and make this happen.

## Product Vision

We're creating the Jarvis of fitness apps. FitAI will use smartphone cameras for real-time body tracking, form analysis, and personalized AI coaching. No extra hardware needed – just your phone and our kickass AI.

## Tech Stack

We're looking at three options:

1. Cloud-based: React Native/Flutter + TensorFlow Lite + AWS/GCP
2. On-device: Native iOS/Android + CoreML/ML Kit
3. Hybrid: Mix of on-device and cloud processing

John, as our CTO, you'll need to weigh in on which approach we should take. Consider scalability, user experience, and development complexity.

## AI Development

Sarah, this is your wheelhouse. We need to focus on:

1. Body analysis and pose estimation
2. Exercise form correction
3. Personalized workout planning
4. Real-time coaching

Let's leverage existing models like MediaPipe and build custom ones where needed. We'll need to source training data from public datasets, synthetic generation, and potentially partner with fitness content providers.

## User Experience

Alex, you're on point for UX/UI. Key features:

- Real-time data overlay on camera feed
- Intuitive exercise guidance
- Progress tracking and goal setting
- Dual AI coach personalities (health/nutrition + fitness/exercise)

Make it slick, make it intuitive, and make it fun.

## Marketing Strategy

Emily, here's where we need your magic:

1. Tech-first launch: GitHub feature, Wired, TechCrunch, etc.
2. AI-generated content: Weekly podcast with our AI coaches, social media posts
3. Influencer partnerships: Focus on tech-savvy fitness enthusiasts
4. Virtual fitness challenges
5. Corporate wellness programs

Let's position ourselves as the cutting-edge, AI-powered fitness solution that's accessible to everyone.

## Business Model

We're looking at a freemium model:

- Basic features free
- Premium subscription for advanced AI coaching
- B2B licensing for gyms and corporate wellness programs
- Potential for in-app purchases (specialized training programs, etc.)

## Development Timeline

Year 1:
- Q1-Q2: MVP development
- Q3: Beta testing
- Q4: Soft launch

Year 2:
- Q1: Full public launch
- Q2-Q4: Rapid iteration based on user feedback

Year 3:
- Expand features
- Explore B2B partnerships
- Consider international expansion

## Intellectual Property

We need to protect our secret sauce. Let's look into:

- Patents on our core AI technology
- Trademarks on brand elements
- Copyrights on our content
- Trade secrets on our AI training methods

## Next Steps

1. John: Finalize tech stack decision
2. Sarah: Begin AI model development
3. Alex: Start UX/UI design
4. Emily: Develop detailed marketing plan
5. Me: I'll work on securing initial funding and partnerships

Let's reconvene next week to align on our progress and iron out any kinks. Remember, we're not just building another fitness app – we're revolutionizing personal training with AI. Let's make it happen!
