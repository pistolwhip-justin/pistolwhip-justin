### Business Plan Overview: Fitness App Leveraging AI

#### Executive Summary
Our proposed fitness app aims to revolutionize the fitness industry by leveraging advanced AI to provide real-time, personalized coaching through live video analysis and overlay data. The app will feature AI models trained in both medical and image analysis to offer users comprehensive feedback, customized exercise recommendations, and real-time coaching. This plan outlines the development, marketing, and IP protection strategies to achieve a significant market presence.

#### Development Plan

**Option 1: Cloud-Based Processing**
- **Architecture:** Mobile app built with React Native/Flutter, TensorFlow Lite for on-device pose estimation, cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP) for heavy processing.
- **Components:** Pre-trained models (MediaPipe for pose detection, custom-trained model for body analysis), real-time video processing using device camera.
- **Pros:** Easier to update AI models, lower device requirements, better scalability, centralized data collection.
- **Cons:** Requires constant internet connection, higher operational costs, potential latency issues.

**Option 2: On-Device Processing**
- **Architecture:** Native iOS/Android development, CoreML (iOS)/ML Kit (Android), optimized on-device AI models.
- **Components:** Local database for exercise library, edge computing for real-time processing.
- **Pros:** Works offline, better privacy, lower operational costs, faster real-time processing.
- **Cons:** Larger app size, device hardware limitations, more complex development, harder to update models.

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- **Architecture:** Native cross-platform framework, mixed on-device/cloud processing, progressive web app capability.
- **Components:** Basic features on-device, complex analysis in cloud, smart caching system, adaptive processing based on device capability.
- **Pros:** Best of both worlds, more flexible, better user experience, scalable.
- **Cons:** Most complex to develop, requires sophisticated architecture, higher initial development cost, complex synchronization.
