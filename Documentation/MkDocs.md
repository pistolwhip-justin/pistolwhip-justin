Project documentation withÂ Markdown.

---

MkDocs is a **fast**, **simple** and **downright gorgeous** static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Start by reading the [introductory tutorial](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/), then check the [User Guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/) for more information.

## Features

### Preview your site as you work

The built-in dev-server allows you to preview your documentation as you're writing it. It will even auto-reload and refresh your browser whenever you save your changes.

### Host anywhere

MkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, or [anywhere](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/) else you choose.
