What makes the Windsurf Editor the first AI agentic IDE, and then some?

# Flows - the way humans are meant to work with AI

## Flows = Agents + Copilots

The Windsurf Editor is powered by an AI that can both collaborate with you like a Copilot and tackle complex tasks independently like an Agent. The AI is completely in sync with you, every step of the way.

Flows allow the dev and AI to operate on the same state at all times, creating a mind-meld experience beyond just an assistant.

## Cascade

Cascade combines deep codebase understanding, a breadth of advanced tools, and a real-time awareness of your actions into a powerful, seamless, and collaborative flow. It is the most powerful way to code with AI.

### Full contextual awareness

Deep contextual awareness allows you to run Cascade on production codebases and still get relevant suggestions.

### Suggest and run commands

Cascade's tools encompass command suggestion and execution, as well as issue detection and debugging.

### Pick up where you left off

With automatic reasoning of your explicit actions, Cascade can pick up your work where you left off.

### Multi-file editing

Coherent multi-file edits through context awareness, tool integration, and iterative problem-solving.

Cascade lets you build and refine complex codebases with ease.

Multi-file multi-edit capability. Deep contextual awareness. Terminal command suggestions. LLM-based search tools that outperform embeddings. Implicit reasoning of your actions in the text editor. Blazing fast latency. All in one magical experience.
