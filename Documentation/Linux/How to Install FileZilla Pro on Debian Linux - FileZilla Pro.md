Follow the steps below to install FileZilla Pro on Debian Linux.

1. Go to the directory where the installation file was downloaded.  
This file is named *FileZilla\_Pro\_\_x86\_64-linux-gnu.tar.bz*.
2. Open the file using the extract tool.
3. Extract the files to the destination directory.
4. Go to the directory where the files were extracted.
5. Go to `FileZilla3 directory`.
6. Start the program using the **filezilla** executable in the `bin/` subdirectory.

**Launch from command line**

If it fails to launch from the file manager you may need to launch from the command line.  
See below how to install and launch from command line:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Change to the directory where the installation file was downloaded,for example:  
cd ~/Downloads/
3. Extract the file with:

tar xf FileZilla\_Pro\_*\_x86\_64-linux-gnu.tar.bz*
4. Launch FileZilla Pro with:  
`FileZilla3/bin/filezilla`

### To create a icon on the desktop:

1. Copy the `FileZilla3/share/applications/filezilla.desktop `to your Desktop directory.  
cp FileZilla3/share/applications/filezilla.desktop $HOME/Desktop
2. Open the file `filezilla.desktop` in a text editor. Adjust the paths at **Exec** and **Icon**  
according to the directory where the installation file was extracted to.**Exec** is the path to the FileZilla Pro executable file. For example:

`Exec=/opt/FileZilla3/bin/filezilla   Icon=/opt/FileZilla3/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/filezilla_pro.svg`

- A shortcut icon is shown on the desktop.
- Right-click the shortcut and choose **Allow launching**.
- The shortcut now shows the FileZilla Pro icon:

- If you use another desktop environment, like KDE, you need to change the shortcut properties to allow execution:

- Right click the shortcut.
- Choose Properties.
- Mark **Is Executable** or **Allow executing file as program**.

**Make it available in the list of applications**

Note that some desktop environments do not support desktop icons. In this case move the `filezilla.desktop `to your *applications* directory:

`mv filezillapro.desktop ~/.local/share/applications`

The shortcut will be in the list of available applications.
