If you are fine with default queue then this step is not required. To create a new queue

1. Goto XDM settings/Scheduler settings
2. Click on the New button
3. New queue will be created. If you want to change your queue name, enter any name below and click the save button above.
4. If you want to schedule the queue, provide the scheduler settings below!
5. Now queue creation is done, press the back button to close the settings page.

Using the queue Whenever the "NEW DOWNLOAD" dialog appears, goto "MORE"/"Download Later" and select you queue name. Note: if you are scheduling, DO NOT start the queue manually, as this will start the download immediately.
