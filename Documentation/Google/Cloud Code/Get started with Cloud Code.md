**Dev environment ready to go** - Cloud Code sets up your dev environment by managing dependencies for you so you’re ready to write, test, and debug application code in minutes. Show Settings

![](https://www.gstatic.com/cloudssh/cloudcode/welcome/deploy_build_setting_1.png)

**Automation of repetitive tasks** - Cloud Code eliminates manual and repetitive steps to build, push, and deploy container images, letting you work faster and with fewer errors.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/cloudssh/cloudcode/welcome/auto_rebuild_1.png)

**Iterative development** - Cloud Code supports hot reloading so you can see your updated application every time you make a code change. With hot reloading enabled, your application is updated nearly instantly as files are synced directly into the container.

**Less context switching** - Cloud Code brings the necessary tools such as log viewing, secret management, and more to the IDE where you need it, so you don’t have to jump between multiple different tools to complete a task.
